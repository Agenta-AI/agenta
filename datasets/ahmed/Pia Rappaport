Pia Rappaport

    Hi. Can you hear me?

Ahmed Jemaa

    Hold on.

Pia Rappaport

    I can't hear you. Hold on.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Can you hear me now? Hello? Can you hear me?

Pia Rappaport

    Can you hear me now? I can hear you, but can you hear me? I can't hear you. Okay. Sorry, baby, I have to take the club's off.

Ahmed Jemaa

    It might be my issue. 1 second. Can you hear me now?

Pia Rappaport

    Yes. Okay.

Ahmed Jemaa

    It's wrong. Although it's not charged, so I probably should have done 15 minutes.

Pia Rappaport

    No, sorry. I logged in at 30, but it's the meeting was closed.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Nice. Okay. Awesome. Yeah. Where are you based, by the way?

Pia Rappaport

    I am in the woods of Brooklyn, new York. New York City. Everybody says I have a tree outside my window.

    They're like some pastoral place, but nowhere in the city. And you're in Berlin, is that right?

Ahmed Jemaa

    Correct. Yeah, actually, I flew back from Barcelona just today morning.

Pia Rappaport

    Okay.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Just for vacation was for golfers there, at the end of the weekend, sunny Spain is usually. Anyway.

Pia Rappaport

    Okay, well, I'm sure you read the hopefully read the description, project description that I put together, if it's okay.

    Let me tell you a little bit about myself and my brand. I worked in luxury. I don't know if they think they're luxury, but midrange luxury fashion.

    For many, many years, I worked at RAF, Lauren, torture virge, and then when I left, I started my own brand on the core brand called philosophy, and that was about six years ago.

    I've had three children during those six years, so it's been a little slow, but now we're done and trying to grow the business.

    There have been years where, you know, the business has grown. There's been years where we've literally. To shift product and not done anything new.

    I had an assistant who was with me with Stevie Marketing. She was with me for the first five years and she left at the beginning of this year, actually, around April.

    She just kind of did everything. She did the social media, she did the email, she did it all, but sort of in a light way.

    She wasn't like super metrics oriented. She just kind of kept it going, which was good at the time. And now we need to ramp up, so that's kind of where we are.

    We've used a number of different tools. Originally we were on MailChimp and then Shopify, and MailChimp had some legal disputes, so then we had to switch to something else.

    So we switched to Omni Sent, which we're still on. I was testing Clay bio shopify just this summer. Their email offering and it would be much cheaper.

    And so I tested that but it wasn't working out. So for all time the purposes was shown on these end.

    We have a number of contacts in there, but I have a social media person who's trying to build our email list and then we're trying to do more direct to consumer, which is why this is an important topic for me.

    But we do have a driving wholesale business mostly through B, two B platforms, and we have all these wholesale contacts who have opted in on the B to B platforms and I've had somebody go through and gather all of their emails.

    So we have a couple of thousand wholesale customer emails that I would like to bring into our actual direct flow.

    I hear that if you opted in over there, maybe we can optimize over here. I'm not sure, but I'm not sure how kosher that is.

    But I would like to start pinning them so you can buy directly from us and then do have some direct wholesale customers.

    So regardless, there's a wholesale customer email flow. There's a trade customer like interior decorators, et cetera. And then there's the direct to consumer, just one off customer list.

Ahmed Jemaa

    So those three things are going on, and right now you're looking to optimize the flows and the automations for the direct consumer.

Pia Rappaport

    I mean, all of it. I just want to make more money.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Makes sense.

Pia Rappaport

    Yeah. At this point, I'm. My kids are off in elementary school and I want to the baby still here, but we have a character and I want to design more product, but I really just want to move through all the inventory that we currently have.

    And we have a lot of great stuff. We know the whole stuff. Customers buy it like crazy. So we just need to find that direct to consumer or customer and get some more cash flow so we can make some more new product.

Ahmed Jemaa

    In terms of the BTB wholesale clients or resellers, I assume, do they come to you organically on the website or do you have like yeah, they either come to us organically or they will search one of these BTB platforms.

    I don't know if you want to call that organically, what they're looking directly or referrals from the platform.

Pia Rappaport

    That's how it's to be. Platforms kind of keep them in platform and they take. Fairly large percent of the already wholesale discounted price, so I'd really like to get away from that.

    But they have I do have their opinion on the BDB platform. I don't have their opt in on my Direct.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Okay, so you collected their email is in the BTB platform?

Pia Rappaport

    No, the BDP platform won't give me their emails. So I found their emails, and I do have if I export my list from the BDP platform, it will give me all the information, excluding their contact information, but with their opt in.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Got you. So basically you have their emails, you have their first names, I assume last names, their business information, how much they searches from us.

Pia Rappaport

    I have everything except it doesn't give us their email. But I've paired it with their email. I've had somebody go through and find all their email.

    I don't know if I need that separately as like a co cuphold or week. One lead thing that's.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Exactly. So my question right now is, if you called email these people because it's still a cold email, they have never kind of opted in to your brand specifically.

    What's the risk in there? And is your domain warmed up? Do you have an additional domain for this? Because usually when you run cold email campaigns, some people and again, when you said they love it and they use their products or they like their products and they sell them like crazy.

    But assuming some of them won't like your outreach, your cold outreach, so they will find you a spam and that might be some issues with durability.

    And so usually people create a couple of additional domains similar to what you currently have, like Dot Co or.net or.org, or something like that.

    And Cold email these people and in those first Cold emails you ask them to subscribe so you get that content and then you can have a flow specific to them in Clayview or any software you're using.

Pia Rappaport

    Okay, so let's just put that it aside. So tell me about the director. I actually have my Admin going through and kind of cleaning it up somewhere between, I would say 3008 thousand contacts she's going through and seeing what if there are duplicates and we've used a bunch of different tools.

    When I look at our different tools, we have different numbers. So she's going through and kind of cleaning that up right now.

    But in any case, let's say we have 5000 contacts. How are we going to increase our AOV and re engage those contacts and.

    How are we going to bring in? I don't know. I mean, with the role that you usually play, obviously we have a pop up people can log into, our people can subscribe right on our website.

    But you're not bringing new customers in is my question. I guess when they opt in you're bringing them into like a welcome series.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Yes. Let me quickly explain the foundation more or less of like retention of things. So what you mentioned earlier in terms of the current list, like you have 5000 contacts or more that's usually used for campaigns or newsletters and that's awesome.

    And then on the other side you have the automation flows which you'll yeah. Trigger based off events tracker. Or triggers triggered on the website by active website visitors.

    And so the list would not be involved in the flows. The flows will be triggering one by 124 seven movements forward.

    The list that you currently have and the contact information that you're going to collect in the future through the opt in forms that you'll have, the pop ups that you have on the site, those emails will be collected and used for the newsletters.

    So you have two sides, more of us. One is the automation flows, the second one is the newsletters and the broadcast campaigns.

    The one too many, like the masks, like the blasts and then the automation, the flows, one to one type of communication in terms of the flows.

    Sure, quickly, in a second, like the whole framework. Structure of the flows that we have. Basically, they cover all the stages from prepurchase so from website visitor, to both purchase.

    So as soon as they purchase, what happens next? And then reengagement when they start lapsing or stop engaging, then try to kind of win them back for the newsletters.

    Yeah. Usually you set up a multi calendar, depending on the useful calendar holidays that you have, as well as the typical kind of promos we're in queue for.

    So you have Black Friday, Cyber Monday. You have all national holidays in the US. And there are plenty of them.

    I assume your products also could be gifted. It correct me if I'm wrong, like you have any customers gifting?

Pia Rappaport

    Other. Yeah, I mean, we sell ornaments and some smaller items. I mean, like the home deport stuff.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Yeah, we have art and bags.

Pia Rappaport

    We have a good number of things that people can buy.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Yes, it's very likely that I assume you probably experience some seasonality by end of year. It's natural seasonality. So people buy more and gift each other and all that stuff for that.

    There are campaigns and promos and all that stuff. And for the automation set of things, there's the photos that I mentioned to you earlier.

Pia Rappaport

    So outside of the I'm aware of all these flows. We have a lot of them set up already. But I'm looking for really like an expert who's going to say, okay, you need to send messages on this.

SCREEN SHARING
Ahmed started screen sharing

    Of the week. And we need to do this kind of different flow that nobody's doing because it's going to work this way.

    We need to segment by price point customers and, you know, like sort of like a deeper thing than we've already done, let's say.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Do you have your account open and we could check it live or like, our email account? Actually, I can start with other I can share that with yeah, usually we do like autistic, by the way.

    So you said you're currently on auto, right?

Pia Rappaport

    Yeah, we're testing Clavio, but I wasn't into it. It didn't seem that different. I don't know if you have an opinion about it.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Yeah, I mean, by market share, clavier is by far like winning. I guess all of them, they have a few best features.

    And on top of that, they also are becoming more of, like, I would say, a data center. Like they're moving towards business intelligence rather than just email.

    So like, you really have a lot of data collected, that's number one. Number two, they connect that data to other platforms or channels.

SCREEN SHARING
Pia started screen sharing

    So let's say you run a Google Ads or Facebook Ads. You can dynamically export some data from Gladio into your remarketing campaigns on Google.

    Or you could create custom audiences from certain lists. And I'll show you in a second how to kind of leverage the tracking capabilities of Clayview with Shopify creates very, very niche.

    Or like. Category specific lists. And based on that, you could export those and run remarking campaigns or call traffic campaigns to people who are interested in those specific categories or interests.

    Let's first go to automation. I want to see the those.

Pia Rappaport

    So I was playing around with some of these, but these are which ones are live and are generating? Well, I was testing shopify directly and played I turned some of these off, but these were the ones that were live down here.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Like car development. Welcome series and birthday email. Yes. Okay. No cross sales, no post purchase, no guarantee engagement.

Pia Rappaport

    So on shopify, I had set up all of those, all of the browsers and and card abandonment. All these things and they couldn't get them to trigger.

    So the last month I've been testing that and they couldn't get them to trigger, I guess because of they said one of the apps, which is from their app store.

Ahmed Jemaa

    There has been news, like a couple of months ago, in August or so, shopify invested in Clayview. So I'm not sure if Shopify is going to compete.

    Actually. It doesn't make that much sense for them to compete with Clavio. Clavia was built seven years ago on Shopify.

    Like, as the main platform for them, it makes sense to acquire Clavia rather than to compete with Clavier. I understand there are some shared emails being sent in.

    Yeah, I'm aware of this shopify mail.

Pia Rappaport

    That's interesting because they just promoted in the summer. Like their big Summer of 2022 launch. They have all these new features and one of them was, you know, use our email, we have all of this automation, we have all of this etc.

    But they literally couldn't I mean, I was on for with them for two weeks. They couldn't get any of these to trigger.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Yeah. Just to give you to share one information, which is most of the brands that are advanced, there's plenty of beginners like the brands that are starting from scratch.

    Some of them not all of them might use clear email, but usually when they work with us, they look to upgrade.

    Upgrade?

Pia Rappaport

    Sure.

Ahmed Jemaa

    If you want to see the return is there's let me show you actually what type of flow so you mentioned.

    Flows, actually, the birthday flow, I don't like it that much because it's only used once a year.

Pia Rappaport

    You can do half birthday. You can use it twice a year?

Ahmed Jemaa

    Yeah, I mean, if you want, but yeah, it's not that useful compared to the other ones. So that's why I kind of dropped it from the lineup of flows that I have no sales from it.

    Here you go. And it's open 40% of the time. Anyway, let me quickly show you what we have right now.

SCREEN SHARING
Ahmed started screen sharing

    Okay, cool. So perfect. Okay, so. So basically, yeah, since we work with different clients at different stages. So we built three plans, activate these four brands, starting from zero, retaining for brands that are doing ten to hundred k, I would say, or even more.

    And scale is for those that are doing plus 100K, plus two hundred k per month. And yeah, the difference between those is that this one is focused purely on the fundamentals.

    So what, you currently have abandoned Cart and welcome series? Kind of. And the flow is more or less the welcome series is slightly different.

    I mean, it is with an incentive. For example, if you look in here, we have them separate, we have the pop up flow and we have the welcome series separately.

    And the difference between. Is that the pop up flow is more focused on the transaction, on the incentive and pushing them to use this kind of code and the welcome series.

    And by the way, let me know when the headset starts making. Yeah. Can you hear me now? Yes. Okay, cool.

Pia Rappaport

    Provide recommendations on the actual promos. I mean, obviously, it has to be tailored, but you say, we really think that a free shipping is better in this case than a discount or whatever.

    It is.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Sure, yes, you do that and I'll show you in a moment. In terms of offers, I call them offers or incentives.

    We have, for example, for the opt in forms or any kind of legion form or any placement of an incentive.

    We have this kind of template where these are all the incentives you could come up with or I mean, you could change the numbers here, but still it's the incentives there and then the goals depending on what you want to do.

    And the cool thing about this is that it will allow us to know what's the true cost of the incentive also on the back end, what's the perceived value of the incentive in the front end.

    So. People perceive that specific offer. Like, one example here would be, like the 10% off, let's say a purchase or something.

    People perceive that as $310 only when I spend, right? Like, if I spend, I get the 10% off. If I don't spend, I won't get the 10% off.

    However, for example, other offers might be, like, I don't know, take part of the contest to win up to $500 worth of something.

    The true cost for you is probably $500 over a month or three months or whatever period you choose. But the perceived value for the receiving or the website visitor is that they might win $500 worth of stock in exchange for nothing, just for their attention or their contact information.

    And so that's a huge discrepancy between the cost and the potential for them or the. For them. And so that's why usually, like, contests and all these things tend to be viral and work out really well.

    So, yeah, this is for the incentives for Black Friday, Cyber Monday, for example, we have these are the offers that you could use in your promise.

    So you could use multiple products, you bundle them together. So bundle deals. You could use long term discounts, like buy I don't like to subscribe and get 10% off or something.

    Conditional discount. So tier 110 percent off, tier two off, tier 325 percent off. And you could get this is actually one of the best offers offers you could do.

    So if you buy up to this, you get this. If you buy up. Up to this, you get this and so on.

    And so it's conditional and it incentivize the right behavior, more or less, and then buy one, get one. It's quite famous, but it's quite aggressive.

    And usually you want to study your back end numbers before offering such a strong offer or aggressive offer. Holiday perks, free gifts, guaranteed delivery date, blah, blah, blah.

    Cashback earn reward points, loyalty points. It's also useful. A lot of people use loyalty programs and then creative offers.

    It could be like, yeah, early bird, VIP, blah, blah. So these are different incentives and they're quite useful for each sale.

    Okay. Does that answer your question or yes.

Pia Rappaport

    Yes, I'm looking for more thought leadership and just setting up and it seems like you do have a perspective, a very clear perspective on what works and what doesn't work or what 2nd.

    3rd. That's what I'm really looking for.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Sure. Yeah. Let me cover this part before we proceed with the other parts. I want to still talk about the flow here because you mentioned only two that you currently have and those two are here a part of the activate.

    And so yep, you are at the right stage in terms of looking to upgrade your automation or your flows.

    And so usually Brent's, in your revenue range, I assume like in the 1023 months something, right? Yeah. So usually Brands is like yours to go for the retain.

    And as I said the advanced brand scale for the scale the difference between those two is that the scale has pre built kind of a b tests within it and they have a few additional flows that are nice to have but are not like essential.

    Like the price drop which is a nice to have basically when products price drops, when you decide to drop the price on a certain product the people who viewed that product in the last 30 days they will get notified immediately like with triggered kind of flow and the site or category event.

    This is when someone visits a category on your website and doesn't proceed to look at any product page or any kind of higher value event or higher intent event like visiting product page or adding to cart or initiative checkout out then usually receive this type of automation.

    Third. A couple of days or hours following up on their activity, trying to kind of show them some best sellers like Iterating on the Mission and the vision of the brand, sharing some proof with testimonials and user generated content and so on and so forth.

    But yeah, usually people who visit categories and then leave immediately, I personally don't see that as a high intent event.

    I'd rather send emails only when they actually visit product pages and then I know, okay, they're interested in that specific product and then we send them follow ups based off the interest.

    And that's the flow that exists already in the retain set up that we're going to talk about here. So basically the retain set up has the pop up flow.

    Basically if someone can send it for SMS, they also receive a couple of SMS communications. But basically the main message.

    Is to welcome them to the brand. The message came from the CEO type of email. Elaborate on the best sellers and of course mention the incentives so that they use it to activate.

    And then we also want to emphasize on the mission and the vision and the values of the brand so that they relate to you.

    If they do and feature the best sellers and show them the cool stuff that you have, then you want to feature some testimonials, some proof, some blogs, content kind of that strengthens the trust in the brand.

    And in the end you want to reiterate on the offer that they have and add some urgency to it.

    With the last one type of messaging, then you have the event of checkout. This is also if the consent for SMS receive a couple of SMS communications featuring.

    Product that they left in the checkout basically with dynamic link to check out with a couple of clicks. If not, they also receive email and an email.

    If they receive this communication in the past or they have been a part of this flow in the past then we ended quickly after or two automations or two followups because we don't want to spend them with the same type of content.

    If they haven't then depending on whether they use the discount code in the welcome series or the pop up series we send them segmented communications.

    If they did then basically we follow up with them with kind of the product they left in cars testimonials and the last reminder with no discount as you can see here because they already used another discount that we gave and so this is more of us trying to be not too dilutive and.

    And aggressive in terms of discounting strategy because that lose the brand and that's not very cool. We only keep the discounts for to activate people.

    Once activated, I don't think there's a lot of there's not so much need for discounts unless they stop engaging and then you need incentivize them again, but so far, they don't need it.

    And then, yeah, here, depending on the card value of the products left in the cart, if it's less than, let's say in your case, what's the average of the value actually on your side?

Pia Rappaport

    It's like $70 and $80. But that's what our wholesale also baked in. I would say direct to consumer. Probably more like in the $30 range.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Okay. Yeah. Assuming, let's say if it's less than 15, then they receive a lower offer. And if it's more than.

    Than 50, then they receive a stronger offer. Because again, if the card value is $100, you probably aren't fine with giving them $10 off or off compared to like when the basket is like like $30 worth.

    Anyway, so that's the initiated checkout and then the card abandonment, straightforward, less aggressive than the checkout abandonment, the browser abandonment.

    Again, this is focused on the product page viewing event. And so if someone is a product page, we fall off for SMS.

    If not, subscribe on SMS or consent for SMS, receive email co ops, and in those emails we feature the products they checked with dynamic tables and then back in stock.

    This is when, in case you're on auto stock, you want to have full of sequence. That reminds people when the product is back in stock.

    Straight, automatic.

Pia Rappaport

    Like we add the units, it goes from zero to greater than zero. And this automatically happen?

Ahmed Jemaa

    Yes. Not just that. So basically we need to optimize or or update a piece of code in your theme so that when the product is out of stock, when the stock is zero, then it changes the call to action on the product page to kind of remind me or send me a reminder when the product is back in stock.

    And so people, when they click on that, they submit their emails and then they basically receive these automations as soon as the product is back in stock.

    So, yeah, fully automated. Cool. And then the post purchase side of things just to go over quickly. So this is probably the most important flow you can see if someone places an order, if they consent.

    These automations. And of course this is dependent on the number or the order account. So if they purchase for the first time, they receive this communication, if they purchase for a second or more, then receive these automations.

    And then here on the email side of things. So usually in the first email, we kind of try to make it personal, share a thank you message from the founder, confirm the order and share some advice or opinions from satisfied customers.

    Then we try to kind of reengage them. You can see here there's a cross sell opportunity. So after a couple of days, after we know, okay, they actually received the product and again, this is changeable or adaptable, depending on your shipping times.

    But basically after they received the other product, then we tried to cross sell them on a product that is compatible with the product they purchased.

    And usually we get list from you in terms of which products are cross sell with which other products and we load that into Playlist and they dynamically do the Cross sells and then yeah, and then we offer discount for the Cross sell for it to happen after we have ourselves.

    And yeah, if they bought more than twice, then we invite them to the VIP program. If you have it, if you don't have it, you can keep it also like this, then yeah, order confirmation and shipping confirmation.

    You already send those from Shopify. Most of the brands do. However, if you want them to be branded and following the same branding guidelines as of the other emails, we can do them in Clavio also.

    On top of that, you'll be able to see the analytics of these emails in terms of engagement rates and open and conversions and all that stuff within Clavio.

    However, don't necessarily have that in Shopify email. And last but not least, the product review. This is straightforward, basically asking customers for reviews and yeah, whether they submitted or not.

    If they didn't, then we also give them another reminder here try to win as many as possible. And last but not least, the re engagement flows.

    If they consider for SMS, they receive SMS communications, if not, just email. And as you can see, this is for lapsed customers.

    Basically they placed order an order in the past but they spent up to more than a couple of months not ordering it again.

    So that's when we follow up with them. And this is for subscribers that have never ordered or added to card or initiated any kind of purchase decision.

    Those get fold up with. As you can see here, after almost five months with testimonials, a lot of proof, and also asking them to get in touch.

    If they don't reply or re engage, then we send them a break up survey and we feature the unsubscribe button.

    And you ask them to answer, subscribe themselves if they don't see any value. And if they don't do that, we suppress them ourselves.

    The reason we do this is basically to protect or clean your list and to make sure that we only keep the interesting or the interested people.

    Otherwise, you have a list full of dead weight. And yeah, that's not good for deliverability.

Pia Rappaport

    The tools are all charging based on active correct.

Ahmed Jemaa

    That's not in your benefit to keep them cool. So that's the retain plan. Again, the scale plan. Like the only additional things here is we have first purchase anniversary, so it's not birthday, but a first purchase anniversary.

    And we actually do it twice a year or, I mean, you can do it once or twice a year.

    And then we have the product review here is a bit more sophisticated. So depending on the sentiment of the review, if they left it, if it's positive, then we incentivize them to buy again.

    If it's negative, then we ask them why and we try to compensate for the experience. And also the post purchase flow here is a bit more sophisticated in terms of so we add one more layer of emails.

    You can see here, the first one here after the thank you kind of message from the CEO. Here we provide a guide on the purchase product from the specific the category they purchase from.

    So it's category specific onboarding. This can be automated or done through dynamic links or something needs to be done manually.

    That's why we kind of limited to the scale plan and we also limited to kind of five categories max because it gets too much at some point.

    Although I see kind of the use case for you. You actually have a few different categories in terms of the type of onboarding you want to have for these categories.

    I'm not sure. What do you think here?

Pia Rappaport

    Like, what categories we would choose? Well, our Market Bags are a best seller, and they're this low price point item.

    So I think the pillow versus the Market Bag customers a little bit different. Those are the biggest poor kitchen, and Market Bags are like, the lower price point items, and then pillows are higher price point items.

Ahmed Jemaa

    So pillows and the kitchen and we don't have like a huge number of how many SKUs do you have on the site?

Pia Rappaport

    I mean, with style and color schemes, it's something like 70. Okay. So it's not like a huge assortment.

Ahmed Jemaa

    It's fine. Cool. Yeah. Any questions regarding the flows?

Pia Rappaport

    No, it seems pretty straightforward. My next question would be about design and then onboarding, like, what steps would you take onboarding a brand like ours?

Ahmed Jemaa

    And then obviously the cost. Sure. Okay. Okay. Alright.

Pia Rappaport

    I don't know if you have a heart stop. I'm okay.

Ahmed Jemaa

    We have ten minutes, basically, as a part of the onboarding so have, I would say, somehow lengthy on boarding process that goes over.

    So it's going to be type forms, and they're going to be three. One for the design and one for the copy and one general brand info.

    Yeah. In terms of the general brand info, we ask you about competitors. Want to check your competitors and see how they're doing.

    We ask you about your audience. So age, gender, targets, where they're located, language they speak, or bailouts. In this case, you.

    Economic status, educational level, relationship status, if any like, if it's useful. If it's not, then it skip. And also, what's very important here, also, if there's any distinctive customer segments or targeting in your case, I don't see for example, we had a case where we were selling to Indians in the US or Chinese in the US.

    Or specific distinctive customer segments. So in that case, I don't think that is relevant to you. And then some copywriting questions.

    So what problem you're trying to solve? What makes your target audience interested in your products? What are their frustrations trends that are occurring in their lives?

    What do they think these are copywriting questions purely, and the copywriter more or less access to ask. These questions to make sure they get as much input from you as possible, to write the copy in your tone and with your logic.

    Yeah. If there's any biases, any objections and concerns, which language do you use? And of course, also ask you about the information about the brand, so the founding date and the creation story, kind of the brand, why you started it, and if your customers are looking at any alternatives, what are the offers that are successful in the market, and so on and so forth.

    If you have collected any kind of customer service, customer information, all that stuff. And then, regardless design part, usually we show you something similar to this design.

Pia Rappaport

    Do you find that design is important?

Ahmed Jemaa

    Do I find the design important? Yes. Of course, especially in your niche.

Pia Rappaport

    I thought that very important. But I don't know if we just send a plain text email just as effective as long as it has that.

Ahmed Jemaa

    So that's a good argument. Yes, plain text emails have their placements and actually in the emails that I'm showing you here, there are a few placements for plaintiff emails.

    They're not like purely plain text here. So, for example, the welcome series here, it's not going to be sorry, not the welcome series here.

    The post purchase where is it? Here. So the first post purchase email, make it personal, kind of. This type of email is a bit you can see no banner.

    No banner with banner. So this is more kind of almost handwritten.

Pia Rappaport

    They feel like they're just getting an email from the founder saying, thank you for purchasing.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Correct. Same here for reengagement emails. Usually we also have plain text type of emails. So when you're eliciting or expecting high engagement reply, backs, all that stuff, if usually you want to have a plain text.

    Okay, where's the entered domain here though, for the core? Here we go. Okay. In terms of your design on Boarding, so we basically collected printers templates in your niche, and we did this for every niche we went through.

    And basically all you need to do as a part of the onboarding is to select which templates you like.

    And not just the template itself, but also the headers, the footers. The way they place or they create or show their icons.

Pia Rappaport

    We have like, a brand styling guide, color perfect, all that stuff perfect.

Ahmed Jemaa

    So we will basically combine the mood board that you will kind of build by selecting the templates you like with the current brand guidelines that you currently have.

    And basically we'll create your templates. So I'm pretty sure yeah, this is not the thing that's going to be hard about the project.

    Yeah. So that's pretty much the onboarding so how much is it going to cost for set up monthly?

Pia Rappaport

    How does it change over time? Yeah, two different groups. The D to see and our wholesale customers. I mean, we'll get a little more.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Straightforward, but yeah, the wholesale customers, I think you probably want to, like, send newsletters to them. I mean, after you re engagement and get their content, you probably want to have you definitely should have one independent flow for them for to be customers.

    And usually you want to have a separate kind of so, like, you probably won't have a landing page even for them on the website.

    You don't already have it? I assume you do. Right here. Go trade a wholesale program. So what's the difference between trade and wholesale?

Pia Rappaport

    Trade is like interior decorators. They get a certain percent discount for their clients.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Okay.

Pia Rappaport

    Trade might be, like, 20% off.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Yeah. So I guess for those two, you probably want to already have.

Pia Rappaport

    With like a little bit more information. I'm going to make this a little simpler, actually. And then these are our BDB platforms.

Ahmed Jemaa

    This airtable air table. Yeah, I mean, it's only fine. So, yeah, basically we can create two additional flows for you to avoid these specific target audiences, as long as yeah, you give us the input and we'll take care of it.

    So shouldn't be a big deal. Now in terms of the pricing. So we have a pricing page. I'm not sure if you've seen our websites in the past, but it's fine.

    Basically, we have a pricing page that explains everything that I mentioned to you earlier, literally well listed. So for the plans that I showed you earlier.

    So we have the activated payment scale. Actually. Also to explain to you, we have phase one and phase two, as you mentioned, like set up and ongoing management.

    So the set up is the phase one, and it's usually focus purely on the highest leverage activities in retention.

    Which are setting up the flows, because that's very important. It's like optimizing the conversion rate of the website or actually designing website.

    It's almost as important. And then we have deliverability setup. This is also quite important. A lot of Brunch struggle with deliverability.

    Like on average, we're seeing, I don't know, probably 70% to 80% of the brands that we work with having deliverability less than 60%.

    Which means that their campaigns are getting 60% of the potential outcome they could be getting because their emails are landing in spam folder.

    Correct. And so that's why we do it as a part of the set up and then the contact list growth.

    This is quite important. If you don't have an email list, there's no list growth and there's almost no business.

    Usually people, when they want to sell their businesses or people who are interested in acquiring businesses, you always ask the question like, hey, how large is your email list?

    Because they know that's something very valuable and that's an asset, a valuable asset. And so, yeah, we focus purely on those in the setup.

    We make sure that you have a contactless growth strategy that is quite aggressive and then the deliverability setup is done properly and then the flows and then and phase two.

    Which I think you're probably also interested in combining both. Which we're also happy to do simultaneously. Kind of. Because we're in Q Four and people are rushing the campaign side of things because we're in October.

    Next Monday is November. Black Friday. Monday. All that stuff. We have different deliverables. So we have campaigns, of course, updating the flows and maintaining them, but we also have campaigns and you could see the number of campaigns per month.

    And then, of course, also some strategies for this growth ongoing performance optimizations with a B tests the flows on the campaigns and.

    Pop ups and fly outs, the discounts and the offerings deliverability segmentation and reporting. I will share after the call.

    I will send you an email that I've told you about, basically. And also there's this video that explains the pricing pretty well.

    And I'll also share with you the recording of this session so that you can also go back to it and see if there's any points that you want to get back to.

    And let me know then which plans you like and when.

Pia Rappaport

    Awesome. I don't want to make you late, so I will review all this and we'll get back in touch.

    Sure. We can just be on regular email, right?

Ahmed Jemaa

    We don't need to be an app or yeah. Usually if we do it on our work, we charge 30% more, because let's take that.

Pia Rappaport

    Okay. All right. Goodbye.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Awesome. Have a nice day. Bye.
