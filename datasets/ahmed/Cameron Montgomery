Cameron Montgomery

    Hey, what's going on? I'm at how are you?

Ahmed Jemaa

    Good. How about you?

Cameron Montgomery

    Doing well, man. Where are you calling in from?

Ahmed Jemaa

    I'm calling from Berlin, Germany. Awesome, man.

Cameron Montgomery

    Well, good to meet. I'm in San Diego, California, typically.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Nice. So it must be still, you know, afternoon or so?

Cameron Montgomery

    So early morning, it's 10.45. Yeah, I've just been basically taking some calls this morning with different freelancers and agencies kind of like interested in our projects.

    And did I give you the actual website examples yet or no?

Ahmed Jemaa

    Not really.

Cameron Montgomery

    No. Okay, cool, cool. So I think today, I'll just kind of tell you a little bit more about me and us and what we're up to.

    And I'll show you through a couple of client examples. that we're working on right now and then, you know, you guys can probably take that information back and talk about it internally or whatever, and shoot us a proposal.

    But yeah, man, so I've been working in marketing for seven or eight years, helping build and scale a couple of different product launch agencies.

    And so typically, you know, clients would come to our agency with the prototype of a product. They're building their content, they're messaging and positioning, really everything around their brand, and then ultimately, like we'd build this hyped up community to launch a product and to scale it.

    So that's kind of the world that I come from. And recently I've been branching out into consulting and just helping a couple of clients in directing their own product launches or helping them scale on the market.

    So that's what I'm up to right now and helping source different service providers through different parts of the the effort basically.

    So I've got a couple different clients right now that are coming to market that need email marketing, but even broader than just looking at your agency, I do think it is like retention.

    Marketing is really probably like a better representation of what they need. And so yeah, when I kind of take you through here, a couple of the clients we have, I'll give you a quick peek.

Ahmed Jemaa

    So they're purely e-conspirant, right?

Cameron Montgomery

    Yeah, yeah. So one of them is to start up and one of them is a pretty heavily funded business that has, it does have, yeah, direct to consumer.

    It does have some retail sales and some things in place, but Yeah, we're mostly talking about ecom, direct-to-consumer. Okay, cool.

SCREEN SHARING
Cameron started screen sharing

    So let's see. So the, I'll sort of with, I guess, the bigger of the clients.

Ahmed Jemaa

    And so, can you see my screen, by the way? Yep, yep, I can see.

Cameron Montgomery

    I'm sharing the right one. Do you see?

Ahmed Jemaa

    I see a little bows in.

Cameron Montgomery

    Yeah. Okay, yeah. Yeah. So, let me refresh here. Yeah, so, so Robeson is a Chinese robotics and manufacturing company.

    And they have basically built a chassis like this, like a robot that connects to Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. And it moves like a human almost.

    And so they also have a license deal with Disney and Pixar to do different characters. So the big one is Optimus Prime.

    That's a product, a big product we're like coming to market with. X launching. Maybe I'll just share like a little bit of the what's the CMS they're using?

    So they I think they have some sort of custom developed front end with a Shopify back end.

Ahmed Jemaa

    I have to ask. Okay, headless, you know, yeah, you really like headless, headless CMS. So yeah, the back end is Shopify and the front end is something else or something custom.

Cameron Montgomery

    Yeah, yeah. So I I'm fairly new with them in terms of like this portion of the project and sourcing.

    So what I would say is yeah, if you have a love to confirm that information with you whatever you need.

    So if you want to drop that in the follow up email specifically like like I'm not sure. Do they really have a dedicated list?

    What is the size of it? I don't think they're doing any sort of email marketing right now. This is all relatively relatively new.

    And they basically need help with, in my opinion, everything. But they are not going with some sort of big full suite agency that does ads and content and email marketing and all that.

    It's kind of being split up to a degree. But the main product they're launching. I think it's a, I don't know, they actually have an option for that we presented an option for them to roll with an agency that does that.

    But the costs were pretty, pretty significantly more to do that right like in terms of like. Yeah, what, what sort of like fee structure they have in place for the for the larger agency so.

    In a sense, we're providing them that option or you know, providing this as an option to them. And then any event they want to.

    Um. piece it together through individual vendors for different for different services. We also want to provide that option as well.

    So.

Ahmed Jemaa

    This is the CMS. I checked the CMS. It's called it's he wind. It's called what? That's the CMS they're using.

    I can send the link. I sent in the chat the name. I use an extension to figure out the text stack of the website and.

    And I'm not sure if you have an integration with play, though. Let me see.

Cameron Montgomery

    So when you but when you hit the by now, if you go to like.

Ahmed Jemaa

    There's no need of integration between clavian and ec with that. Which means that yeah, probably. And when I see they have Mail also as an email source provider, they're using.

    Um, yeah, I'm not sure if I can help with projects that don't have yet. I believe you as an ESP and usually like the standard.

    CMS is that connect with clavio. As CMS is usually less like WooCommerce, become a shopify. Magento, so these connect natively with clavio and everything else doesn't.

Cameron Montgomery

    So I also sent a link. So if you hit by now that there's a go to a US website.

    I think this is built on Shopify.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Do you see the link I put here? How do you know it's built on Shopify?

Cameron Montgomery

    It looks like a Shopify theme. And I thought that's what they said they were.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Okay, interesting.

Cameron Montgomery

    So I gave you the links to the US at riversand.com and the chat does, are you able to check to see?

Ahmed Jemaa

    Yeah, that's a Shopify theme. Yeah, it's inlet, it's a Shopify theme. Okay, interesting. So this is better.

Cameron Montgomery

    Yeah, so yeah, so from the, it's, it's, it's this thing where the Chinese marketing team has like led some of this stuff, the front end.

    Yeah, like you said, has built on something else. But as soon as someone goes to Shop, quote unquote, or clicks through that, it takes them to the US store.

    I think they're trying to separate it a little bit. And so the crew I'm with is responsible for like, mostly targeted sales.

    in the US. And so this is where I think most of it would live. So is that still an issue for you that it's set up that way?

Ahmed Jemaa

    No, that's fine. No, it's fine. I'm actually curious now, how many SKUs do you have?

Cameron Montgomery

    Let's see. So it looks like one, two, three, four, five, six in total. I'm not sure what this is.

Ahmed Jemaa

    OK, six products, enters the packet.

Cameron Montgomery

    Really what they're looking to do, and I don't know if it's possible to spread it out, but the main ones they want to sell are the Optimus Prime and the trailer kit.

    So this thing actually breaks down into a truck, but actually pull that. Yeah, so I can get clarity on that.

    But yeah, so that's the idea at least for now is focus. I guess on that. And then there's also kind of like this, a Buzz Light Ear product coming out as well.

    I think that was on the homepage. So, yeah, if that, you know, of course, if the number of scooters or products changes the, you know, the scope or the proposal, just be sure to note that I can get some more clarity on where they want to draw the line with this, but it's kind of like, it's like hard to only do a couple products and not own the whole thing.

    I would imagine, right?

Ahmed Jemaa

    Usually, no, it's not about, we don't offer like the product specific scope or just like we use dynamic links.

    So regardless of how many products are there. I was curious, asked about the SKUs to actually figure out how many categories you guys have.

    It seems like it's only one category with six products. And so it's only fine. That doesn't change the price because

    Again, we're going to use dynamic links, which will work with every product. It doesn't scale our operations in the back.

Cameron Montgomery

    Okay, cool. Yeah, it's, it's all definitely the same category, like, um, of kind of a. Robot enthusiast, comic con.

    It's a decent price fund. I think it's around like the version that we're dropping. It's going to be around like $700.

    So it's not cheap, but they have a lot of margin to acquire the customer and, and their. So, you know, our customer is also typically, you know, a little bit more affluent or, you know, using disposal income on things like that.

    So, um, so yeah, that that's one of the products. So, and then I forgot to share the other. The other one is a star.

SCREEN SHARING
Cameron started screen sharing

    startup that it just doesn't have any foundation setup yet. And they're a little bit more tight on money. And it may just be that this particular project is like a setup project where, I don't know, maybe what it makes sense to do ongoing work, but they've got a, they've got a web flow website.

    And so it's the product is this sort of like AR, I wear a device, it clips onto your glasses.

    It can zoom and can capture photo and video. It's not really like consumer ready. I mean, we're really trying to launch this in Q4 and sell like only like 300 units.

    They have a 500,000 person list. That's a little old. It's about a year, year and a half old from just some like the gen exercises we were doing to judge interest.

    But we're redesigning the site and the messaging now to position it toward developers that we want to kind of build and hack the device.

    There's also like a discord community associated with it as well. So we're going through a site redesign, but coming out of that we want to kind of get the base framework of clavio setup maybe do some reengagement emails.

Ahmed Jemaa

    You said you guys are on with flow. Webflow doesn't have a native integration with clavio. Like you have a backend for like shop and fire something here or you can go.

Cameron Montgomery

    I think I don't know. Yeah, it's what flow through and through.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Yeah, it's going to be a bit tricky.

Cameron Montgomery

    Yeah.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Okay, so.

Cameron Montgomery

    Okay, gotcha. Gotcha. So for this one. Do you know whoops does clavio or does you know if webflow has other.

    System. Sometimes they are natively integrated both.

Ahmed Jemaa

    It's not so sure actually. I'm not even sure about like what flow actually what flow projects are usually not e-commerce projects.

    So like most e-commerce friends would not build on web flow. Actually, this is one of the most demanded kind of features on like they've recently launched the e-commerce theater and it's not mature like it's not very reliable.

    I would say and they lack a lot of features.

Cameron Montgomery

    Okay, your guys are strictly clabbier, right?

Ahmed Jemaa

    I would say so, yeah.

Cameron Montgomery

    Okay, cool, cool. Well, this might work. I mean, we've already been talking about like considering moving out of web flow into Shopify.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Yeah, I mean, I think they can do like what the previous brand did. Which is like web flow I know like it has much better aesthetic.

    Then then help fire were. Yeah, I mean, although Shopify actually one sec. There's a ripplo. You probably want to share with them.

    Yeah, probably want to share with him this resource. Share them with chat. If they're concerned about like the design and the aesthetic of the website, because again, I'm pretty sure most of the flow people go with webflow because it's really, really like clean and like high end and fast and all that stuff, which is not 100% the case with like top of fire and the CMS because yeah, there are features that are built towards like, yeah, converting and all that stuff.

    So you could combine both under the app that I shared on the webflow. It's actually like a recent startup from YC Combinator.

    And yeah, they crack the code of like. Offering templates. I'll shopify that are super high end and that don't need a lot of like design.

    Input from like the 90. Sorry, developers team. So, basically you get the developers, custom design quality for. Yeah, a fraction of the cost.

    And if fraction of the time it takes to do that. And so they might, they should be lifted. Or something like that, or they do the headless thing, which is also.

    Yeah, compatible with with shopify.

Cameron Montgomery

    Okay, and is by headless, you mean that's just. Some sort of different front end and then a shopify back end.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Correct. Okay.

Cameron Montgomery

    Cool. So, yeah, so those are the kind of like the two immediate clients I'm working with right now, always have like, you know, typically more popping up every quarter but yeah would love for either kind of yeah tell me a little bit about your background how you got started with things where you're at now.

    Love to know all that.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Yeah, so basically I run econ maniacs it's a retention marketing agency. I send you check my website if you haven't, I can quickly go through it.

SCREEN SHARING
Ahmed started screen sharing

    Basically, we're really focused on servicing econ or sprints with the retention services so we email and especially if you can load and on top of that as well.

    Contactless growth testing offers setting up the mobility. making sure that that our privacy is like the best practices are followed.

    You can see performance optimization reporting in loyalty and segmentation and multi-channel. With multi-channel we mean like email SMS and loyalty and subscriptions all synchronized together.

    In terms of. Yeah, our kind of, I would say most popular offers are early retention focused. So. So these are our plans for usually have like.

    Phase one and phase two phase one is usually for the setup of the flows. And actually I'd like to explain this way so in email working there's two phases.

    Phase one which is usually it's about the setup of the foundation and phase two is usually about like maintaining that foundation and improving it over time.

    And so the foundation is, yeah, usually we take three to four weeks to set it up. In the foundation, we were talking usually about like setting up the lows, try the automations that work 24 seven, following up on even triggers on the website.

    And you have the deliverability, which is again, one of the most important. Tell us off three-inch marketing, because if you have poor deliverability, your emails won't land in the inbox.

    And then basically, if you haven't say 60% deliverability, it means that you're missing out on 40% of the potential.

    Engagement rates results outcome on your email marketing program. And on top of that, this growth. So if you don't have a list, you don't have a business in one of the most valuable assets in any covers businesses to actually have a subscribers list.

    So those are kind of the key pillars of the foundation outside. You're growing the list, you're optimizing. for higher deliverability and you're making sure that you're capitalizing on the website visitors in terms of like tracking their events and their movements and then following up with them based off the degree of um, of intent um, they're in, if it's high intent for example adding to cart, then you follow up with the SNS and email sequences um, and if there, let's say just in a product page and then you follow up with the right um, yeah sequence.

    For that we have a framework um, that we kind of refined over the years and it's really yeah. So here we go.

    So then, so depending on the plan we have different um, content strategy. I could go over the scale quickly and then I can show you the difference between them and the rest but basically as you can see there's.

    pre-purchase flows, post-purchase flows and re-engagement flows. In total they can amount to 72 emails and SMSSes. And all of them are triggering in a smart way.

    So if you go here you could see, for example, the pop-up flow triggers, depending, for example, on the, you could run this, depending on the geography.

    So let's say for people who are in the north of the US they receive a different offer from those in the south of the US, for example, or east to west, whatever, or international and local.

    And for those who are considered for SMS, they receive an automation with SMS, if not, then they receive only email.

    And depending on how engaged they are with email, if they open the email in the past, then skip this slide.

    If not, then we will send them the first email because it's such an important email. And then afterwards, depending on also, like, we could run a test with them to set up.

    But yeah. You can see the content here, content strategy of each and every email is almost there. Of course, there's room for customization, but this is based on best practices and declines as a part of the onboarding we ask them questions if they need to add or if they want to add any form of customization to these, we're more than happy to do so.

    Same goes for the welcome series, although here we have a split customer versus non-customer. You can see here checkout abandonment and this is basically the last step before buying and if they consulted for SMS they received text messages on follow-ups.

    If not, then you can see here depending on whether they've been in this flow before in the past or not, if not, then the, if yes, then it ends there.

    If not, then depending on the whether they used the pop-up flow discount or not, if they did then, I'm sorry, if they did then.

    And they don't receive a discount. If they didn't, then they receive a discount depending on the cart value. So let's say in your case, Robozin, like, robot is, I don't know, if they added to cart something with 700 bucks, then more than 700 bucks, then they receive, I don't know.

    And it dollars off, if not, then, yeah, $50 off or if less than $50 off, something like that. So the flows are smart.

    Same goes for the cart abandonment. Same goes for the browser abandonment, although here, we also do something. So if someone viewed a product more than two times, then they receive that product in the browser abandonment.

    If not, then there's even random selection of best sellers. Here, the browser abandonment, it's basically a flow that triggers based off whether someone viewed a product page in the last.

    Now we can get the sold and run to do it this year. 30 days or not. And of course, the view the product page and did not proceed to add to cart or purchase.

    So these, these flows are higher intent flows. And so they override everything else that is below in terms of intent.

    And you can see site and category abandonment. There's back in stock. There's price drop. And so, yeah, we cover almost all the use cases.

    So that was the purchase now post purchase side of things you have. Post purchase flows here, depending on when the consent process or not, if they did, then depending on the order account.

    It's the first order they received this sequence. If it's the second order, they receive this sequence. If it's the third, then they only receive email and you get invited to be.

    And here also depending on the category they purchased from, that's why I asked you earlier about the category. In your case, it's not very relevant.

    And so depending on that. product they purchase from, then they receive category specific onboarding, and then of course a cross-hell and series or sequence trying to cross-hell them on, in your case, that's the warranty, I guess.

    Yeah, the warranty that they can extend over a couple years. Yeah, so that's for the post purchase, then we have the order confirmation, the shipping confirmation, the product review, and also here, depending on the type of the review, we can pull up the different messaging, if it's positive, we thank them and we encourage them to buy again, if it's negative, then we try to ask why, and then there's also the first purchase anniversary.

    Last but not least, there's the re-engaging of those customer-winning back, it says it's low customer-winning back this for existing customers, and it says it's low for subscribers.

    who have not purchased yet. And for those, we send them a couple of reminders, then a warning, and then we break up with them kind of.

    So we suppress them from the list to make sure that the list is not filled out with deadwood more or less.

    Yeah, that's pretty much it. Do you have any questions regarding this?

Cameron Montgomery

    I think that's pretty good for now. I mean, it's super robust. Yeah, great to see, you know, what you guys are working on.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Yeah, in terms of, so that's one side. So the flows can I set up? Now regarding the campaigns, we made it super easy to come up with, like usually like the struggle that we run space when coming up with or setting up a campaign calendar is to actually come up with ideas for those campaigns.

    And so literally we made it super easy here. So we have all types of campaigns here. And in the back end, we...

    know which campaign what type of content goes in each and every campaign you can see here the bundle campaign the best song campaign the given back campaign the giveaway campaign the gift card campaign sales extended campaign you do the campaign or campaign i don't know a product launch campaign company birthday campaign gift card campaign all type of stuff was campaign press campaign reviews campaign limited edition clearance all that stuff also we can do the product launches as well so that's that and in terms of the av tests it also like these are all the av tests that you could run on the subject line design and templates and things settings as well and in terms of segmentation we have all types of segments that you could tend to based off engagement as well as based off interest in categories and products as well as erfm framework which stands for recency frequency and monetary value it's quite important because based off that we could rank uh...

    and differentiate between potential customers. And of course, loyal as well. So yeah, this makes it extremely easy to populate a campaign calendar like this.

    And one last thing is the, I'm gonna fill it with the confidential thing. Yeah, here we go. Yeah, and it comes to National Holidays.

    Yeah, we have scraped all the National Holidays in the US. And basically for every day you could see here, first of November we have almost 10 or so holidays that we could send a campaign to that.

    And yeah, depending on the niche and all that stuff. So we'll never run out of ideas for campaigns. Yeah, so that's on the campaign set of things.

    I mean, I could go and discuss like incentives and A.B. testing and all that stuff, but I don't think that's really relevant at the stage.

    What you're probably interested in is to see something like this. I'll send it over right after the call, but basically it's a link that summarizes a lot of the stuff that we do.

    And recorded in video. So this is the type of services that we offer. So all the services explained, the flows that I explained earlier, low of the subscription.

    Micro influencers, which is something else that we do. Contactless growth and deliverability. So these are kind of the most important things that people need to understand before engaging to work with us.

    And then I'm going to give that even testimonials, but you can not later. Yeah, we were clients. Yeah, given their opinion on what they've seen by working with us.

    Some documented case studies and testimonials. And also here how it's like to work with us. So here the onboarding process explained the design process explained because a lot of people asked about the quality of designs that we explained the design process.

    And we do the proper. process, the operational excellence process to how we actually operate. And this is also explained quite briefly here to how it works.

    Page where you see, depending on the stage, depending on where you are, it's actually quite self-explanatory. It shows you how we actually operate internally in terms of checklists and pm side of things.

    And then the project measurement, A.B. testing, rate of offers, and then the pricing explained and us versus them if you want to compare to others.

    And yeah, these are more or less tools of engagement. Basically, I'm really going to review how to fail a project.

    Ironically, meaning like, hey, how not to fail a project. Just to make sure that we have the right expectations on both ends.

    So yeah, that's to be sure you write out the call. By the way, I see my battery is dying soon.

    So do you have any questions?

Cameron Montgomery

    I'm gonna do this. No, no, man, this is really great. This is a very robust presentation. And so yeah, I think that the link would be helpful.

    You know, you've got everything listed there. So we can go ahead and go through that. And then in the interim, now that you have kind of the the Riveson site and an idea of what we're working on, you just think about it internally, come up with any lists of clarifying questions you have and just email that to me.

    Whatever you feel like you need to come up with some sort of like scope recommendation or maybe there's two different tiers that they could do.

    I'd love to know what you're thinking and why. And then as soon as we kind of get clarity there and you guys have an idea of what you wanna do, just let me know.

    Hello about that. Maybe we can set up a follow up call.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Well, you told me that the Roblison has like how big is the email list actually like 5,5k or so.

Cameron Montgomery

    No, that was the other product that was monocle. I'm not sure with Roblison existing size, things like that. So yeah, if you, I would say if you have a list of questions, you know, just formalize that for me.

    Shoot shoot shoot it to me in an email and I make sure we get them all answered.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Yeah, sounds good.

Cameron Montgomery

    Okay. Awesome.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Well, thank you for the time. I appreciate it. Welcome. Yeah, we're going to have a nice rest of it.

Cameron Montgomery

    Talk to you soon. Bye bye.
