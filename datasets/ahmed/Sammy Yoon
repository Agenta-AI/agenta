Sammy Yoon

    Hey, what's up, man? I'm Edward.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Yes. How's it going?

Sammy Yoon

    Good, dude.

Ahmed Jemaa

    How are you? I'm good. Where are you based?

Sammy Yoon

    We're in Denver, actually. Just moved. We're in Colorado Springs now. Nice. Yeah. So basically, dude, honestly, I took a look at your proposal and your website.

    I'm sure you already know it looks nice. Website? Fucking killer. I definitely had a truck. I'm sure you've hired people on Upwork, right?

    Yeah. You know that a ton of applicants come in, so I already know that it's like your skill level is probably among the best.

    But the one thing that I'd be concerned with is that our scale right now, Kent, is it? Our current deal isn't high enough to justify maybe the additional fees you'd be charging on top of what other people are charging.

    Just because let's say I'm sure you can improve the conversion rate some compared to like other email providers, but I'm not sure if our was big enough to cover the extra fees you'd be charging essentially, if you know what I mean.

Ahmed Jemaa

    We don't talk too much about fees when I look at the outside the return on investment.

Sammy Yoon

    Yeah, right.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Actually, I think you're doing 100K revenue wise where this month will do a little over 100 on the shopify site 3%.

    I think it's well, justifiable the stuff that I'm going to show you. I'm super interested. For sure. I'd love to hear what your fee structures look like.

    Yeah, actually, it's on the website. It's very transparent. It's straightforward, it's laid out. Like what we do in these calls is actually figuring out which plan is best for you.

Sammy Yoon

    Okay, cool.

Ahmed Jemaa

    It's not excellent. It's affordable compared to guys in the US. What they charge in the US, though?

Sammy Yoon

    You're in Canada?

Ahmed Jemaa

    No.

Sammy Yoon

    Oh, you're in Germany? Shit. Okay, never mind.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Sorry. Okay. Cool to read the prices.

Sammy Yoon

    Yeah. Let me scope your website real quick. Pricing. Let's go back to fucking internet, dude. Keep these things on.

    Okay, so I pulled it up.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Established brands, and those are recommended plans, like per the volume of matchmaking. But usually the scope is the one that you probably want to decide based on, in terms of what you're getting for the service.

Sammy Yoon

    Let me just explain my math to you, right? Like, again, dude, obviously you guys have a premium service. I'm not trying to cheap out.

    I'm not trying to fucking negotiate. Right? Okay. They say that they're trying to yeah, okay, but let me just explain the math, right?

    So I have another guy in the US. He will do all the campaigns and flow set up for a flat two K a month cancel time.

    There's no additional charge for the flow setup. And let's say he can get to, like which is pretty great.

    I'm not going to lie. 20% would be great. Of revenue coming from email. Then I'm not saying you wouldn't do better, but it would be a marginal there's a certain cap to how good it can get.

    Know what I mean? As you get higher, the amount you can improve. Come smaller, right?

Ahmed Jemaa

    Yeah. Marginal return.

Sammy Yoon

    Right. The improvement always gets smaller as you go towards the top end of the scale. And I'm just worried that basically the difference in price between your service and his service, it's not going to cover the one k difference right.

    In conversions. Because it's not like he's doing a bad job.

Ahmed Jemaa

    You guys do a great job, but he's not doing a bad job either. Okay, look, I mean, I totally understand the diminished return kind of argument.

    I really get that. Well, first, I'm pretty sure what you told me right now is not better of what we do is not better.

    And here's why you asked. You said to pay for how long? It's like principle any time. And both flows and campaigns.

    Do you know what you're getting exactly? Or it just flows and then you get two per month coming.

Sammy Yoon

    One campaign per week consisting of two emails per campaign.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Two emails per campaign. It might be one email per campaign, but it was not. You might be. So you got a proposal, I guess, right?

Sammy Yoon

    Yeah.

Ahmed Jemaa

    So what's in the proposal? Will, if you show me the proposal, I can offer you better.

Sammy Yoon

    I can guarantee. Okay, 1 second. I have a lot of messages here.

Ahmed Jemaa

    This is pretty funny, actually. Yeah. I like how straightforward you are.

Sammy Yoon

    Hell, yeah. I'm looking for another real person. I don't want some fucking okay, cool. I'm trying to find your name.

    So how long have you been running?

Ahmed Jemaa

    We're? Almost three years.

Sammy Yoon

    Yeah. Dan, you must've. You built a quick, then I would say so.

Ahmed Jemaa

    I always feel like right now I'm considering, like, last year I was considering selling it. This year, actually, I'm I'm not sure if it's that sellable.

Sammy Yoon

    Oh, really? Looking into, like, agency sales, like a big agency, you can just absorb your clients.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Yeah, they can.

Sammy Yoon

    Is the value just not that great for agency?

Ahmed Jemaa

    No. So last year, I think we were, like, super progressive in terms of scaling and stuff, but then the service was not that great.

    And then this year, I scaled the service. Like, I improved the service a lot. And the thing is, when you approve of service, availability becomes an issue.

    Because you need to train everyone to match that, like, team to match that standard. And also, it adds a lot of, like, attention to details in the back end, which is not guaranteed when you scale quickly.

    That's why we lower the volume. And, yeah, I just realized the UserVoice business is not scalable. Yeah.

Sammy Yoon

    You need just a fuck kind of labor.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Exactly. And other types of issues that I struggle with, you can pull out. You can build a brand, like one hundred K per month brand with three people.

    Two people. Here you go. Yeah, me and my boy. Yeah, we barely work exactly. With agencies, different agencies. Like, every additional 15 to 20 to hire someone.

    And they have to kind of fit in. Yeah. Turnover of all the employees. Exactly. And we quit every now and then.

    Actually, I found a message.

Sammy Yoon

    Let me show you. I'll just send you a street. Send it to the zoom chat. But I'm not going to lie, man.

    This dude is also really good. Like, this dude is really good.

Ahmed Jemaa

    There are good people there.

Sammy Yoon

    Yeah.

Ahmed Jemaa

    His writing to campaign emails per week. Template design. So all flow set up. What does that mean, all flow set up?

Sammy Yoon

    I'm guessing isn't there some sort of industry standard, like people it's like top three flows make, like, your 70% of revenue and.

Ahmed Jemaa

    And then you got your nine backup close to make twelve dozen flows, like a dozen close total to estimate basically eight campaigns per month.

    And I don't get the all flow set up thing. I'm going to show you now what the flows I set up for my clients are.

    And yeah, also for SMS, we don't set them separately, we actually combine them.

Sammy Yoon

    Right, so it's like one promotion and then you're just sending it out into two different avenues, you know what I mean?

Ahmed Jemaa

    Okay, let me explain. Flows triggering based off event that I'm tracked on the website and the campaign. Batch, you send them one too many kind of lessons.

    And so in terms of like promotions or stuff, you could send an email, SMS, and you can do that.

    But the cool thing is with the flow, you can have multi touch approach. So let's say, for example, someone been in the cart or like started to welcome flow.

    They can receive a text and then a couple of hours they receive the email. Everything is synchronized. It's not overlapping.

    It's well synchronized. It's very important, actually. I remember end of last year, a lot of my clients were asking, hey, are they receiving the same messaging on two channels at the same time?

Sammy Yoon

    Or one solution I found is to actually track every touch point and kind of delay the messages.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Yes, it's quite a lot of work. Make sure that these things don't overlap and don't annoy people because. If you have two touch points that are quite similar at the same time, people get pissed off anyway.

    So let me quickly I'll leave it to you to compare actually, it seems to me very simplistic though I will quickly show you what I'll talk about actually, why we have two plans and if combined with that's, fine.

SCREEN SHARING
Ahmed started screen sharing

    But I found this to be the most reasonable set up because the flows you set them up once and for all like that's the one time offer it's like building a website it's quite important.

SCREEN SHARING
Ahmed started screen sharing

    It's actually one of the fundamentals if I start an ecommerce brand today, the first thing I want to do is actually set up a close because these people are these close will continue to do the work for you day in, day out, whether you want to add or not, whether you just.

    Like having like optimizing your conversion rate or on the website feed or something like that. So that's number one.

    The two other things within the flow set up or the phase one that they call it here is the deliverability, which is quite important as we get into for Friday or Monday, you definitely need to optimize your deliverability.

    It's basically the definition of deliverability is the ability of your emails in the inbox. And your deliverability percentage is how much of your emails in the inbox.

    And if they don't in the inbox, usually the open rate is zero. So everything that's done in the inbox would not be open.

    Like zero point something would be open. So if you have, let's say, 50% of their ability rate, it would mean that you're getting 50% of the potential outcomes that you could get from your emails.

Sammy Yoon

    Is there a way to track the livability rate?

Ahmed Jemaa

    Yes. So that's something we do. We use software for this, basically, just to show you. This is extremely it happens quite often.

    People have 67% no, it's not fluctuate. I mean, it depends on the brand. So this one has four deliverability.

    They sent emails to the whole list that was not engaged. So it's not the same brand. These are different brands.

    And some brands sent emails to an engaged list and kept you in their list over time, and some brands didn't then that's the outcome.

    And it's very hard to fix it. So we want to do it properly. If it gets damaged, you need to start with a new domain, otherwise it's very hard to recover anyway.

    So going back to the flows. As you probably have seen here, we have three plans. And also here in the flow setup, we have three plans on set.

    So these are the plans. Activate. Yeah, we have the active. This is the activate. This is the scale. Okay.

    And per your revenue numbers and per, what I recommend to the majority of my clients is that they should go with the retain.

    It's the most value for their money. And here's why. So the scale is super advanced. With the scale you have, we have conditional splits that are a bit too much.

    I would call them in, for example, your location for the region or the country. You could offer different incentives in the pop up flow.

    So, for example, if someone submits their contact information, exchange for incentives for the US. You could offer free shipping or Canada, you could offer, I don't know, like 10% off or international.

    You could offer, I don't know, a freebie or digital download or whatever, right? And then you have also split to your customer versus non customers.

    We have a b tests within the set up of flows. We have, let's say, let me show you some other conditional splits here.

    So here branches with different discounts offer based off the card value. So let's say someone has a card value of like $100.

    You probably want to offer them a bit more aggressive offer than those who have $50 that's set up in there once and for all in terms of also the air conditioning split depending on whether they receive this flow in the past or not to make it less spammy a lot of burns and send emails.

    In our case, we make sure that's. When we send emails, they're actually indulgent and they're actually not too much not repetitive because here, like if they received the same floor, if they've been in the same flow in the past, the flow ends quickly.

    It doesn't proceed with the rest of the emails. Here here, for example and by the way sorry, I jumped too quickly into the as you can see here, there are three categories prep purchase, both purchase and reimbursement flows.

    And you can see here we have six. Eight flows in the pre purchase set of things. Five in the post purchase and two in the re engagement.

    This is for the scales. Actually, I need to show you the retain, which I would recommend to you. The retain is similar to scale, it's just that is again, not limited, but focus purely on the revenue generating flows and core flows that are quite important.

Sammy Yoon

    Okay, that makes a lot of sense. Versus like customer. Relationship is more important for a scaling business that needs a lot of exposure.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Yeah. So there's a lot of like affinities here that are super, super like, I would say advanced and yeah, here I would talk about the diminishing returns.

    Like some optimizations would not have a real very measurable impact.

Sammy Yoon

    Yeah.

Ahmed Jemaa

    However, here that's not the case. Here everything is really impactful. So here we have the pop up flow and you can see SMS email.

    So this is here, check out abandoned, checkout abandoned cart rose abandonment back in stock. And then this is the post purchase side of things.

    So you see here, SMS conditional splits order account.

Sammy Yoon

    So depending on the order account, they receive different.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Yeah, if it's the first time they received this flow. If it's the second time you see this flow if it's more than the second time then you get invited to VIP program if you have one order confirmation.

    Shipping confirmation those are already sent through shopify I believe in your case but we make them encourage you to collect the data in clay a second to make them own brand because it's not very easy to get somebody in the product review flow task for reviews and collect them and get some music or the content and then the re engagement so this is customer win back and since it's flow straight forward this is for customers and this is for subscribers that's a great I got a good idea of what you guys would be doing just one question would be how many campaigns do you usually send per month for each plan?

    Yeah so for the campaign let me show you it depends on the plan that you. With, I believe right now, since we're entering like seven Monday season, I think you're going to probably combine both.

    So the phase one flow set up and probably the phase two. And if you go with both, I offer something as an insight for the bundle.

    But usually, again, so we have the set up and then they don't go in management.

Sammy Yoon

    I see what the set up is. A monthly charge. Can I ask why that's not a fixed price for the set up and then a monthly for the ongoing yes.

Ahmed Jemaa

    So for the set up, it's usually a lot more work.

Sammy Yoon

    And actually I can tell you here in terms of the oh, no, I believe it's a lot of work.

    I'm wondering why you wouldn't charge just like, I don't know, five, ten K up front instead of doing it.

    Is it because you're not sure how long it will take?

Ahmed Jemaa

    It takes three to four weeks.

Sammy Yoon

    But you see how with the phase one each of the plans, it's like monthly, right?

Ahmed Jemaa

    No, this is one month, so three to four weeks. It's done once, and you can see the cost is capped.

    It's not ongoing. Th this is wrong.

Sammy Yoon

    Okay. Yeah. That's what was confusing me. That's it.

Ahmed Jemaa

    You know what I mean? Yeah. This is the per month thing. Sorry.

Sammy Yoon

    Okay. Yeah, that makes a lot more sense. Yeah. Okay.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Thanks for responding. Actually, I need to be alive for months. Damn, dude.

Sammy Yoon

    I'm sure you still got clients, right? Yeah.

Ahmed Jemaa

    I mean, for the monthly and the quarterly. So that's for the ongoing management.

Sammy Yoon

    Perfect.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Yeah. And here, it's a different scope. Usually, it's like the campaigns here, emails and SMS are different. And you can see 816.

    So what you're getting from that guy is the AV test, the list growth, the offer, the deliverability.

Sammy Yoon

    That has everything I need. I'm just going to talk to my business partner and I'll get back to you.

Ahmed Jemaa

    That sounds good. If you want. Actually, as a part of the journey, as a part of the follow up, because I'd like to share with you some important resources.

    So usually I share a link with you. This link basically explain literally everything on demand. So if you want to, let say, understand what loyalty is, or subscription, which right now, but there are some case studies here, some client interviews.

    You could watch them.

Sammy Yoon

    Perfect, dude. I'll take a look.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Also. In terms of our on boarding process and how we work. So everything is also explained here in terms of, like, how we on board the design process, the copy.

    I'll try to send a new ticket from there.

Sammy Yoon

    Sweet. That's perfect, man. I'll talk to you soon.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Cool. Thank you so much. Thanks. Peace.
