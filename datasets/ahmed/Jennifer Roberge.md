Jennifer Roberge

    Hello.

Ahmed Jemaa

    How are you? I'm good. How about you?

Jennifer Roberge

    I just.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Hi.

Jennifer Roberge

    How's life? Good. Good to meet you.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Where are you based?

Jennifer Roberge

    Montreal.

Ahmed Jemaa

    I'm a little bit nervous. I don't speak French, but. It's not my native language.

Jennifer Roberge

    I. It's my second language, actually, but I.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Six years in German.

Jennifer Roberge

    I forgot most of my French.

Ahmed Jemaa

    We're in Germany. Are you.

Jennifer Roberge

    I'm busy. Mm hmm. I studied in fiber. I love Germany. I studied it for eight years and I was terrible.

    I'm a horrible language person, but I love Germany.

Ahmed Jemaa

    You're probably the first person who. Well, yeah, probably. graduating but yeah one of the very few people who loved to join me so much and that's such a good memory it was a university it was great traveling and partying and oh it's fun so fun okay that's your point to your point actually yeah I don't know German university life I think it depends on the university I guess but in my experience yeah universities in the US or a North America much more fun than in Germany yeah but I got to experience both and I was an exchange student so it was like we it was different it was very not serious that's a good point that's a good point yeah yeah because uni students in Germany are quite it's intense life from what I saw but it wasn't for us I don't know how we passed our yeah I don't know it was fun we sometimes went to class yeah this is yeah no good for you

Jennifer Roberge

    Yeah, no, Germany's fun. I ate too much sausage and pretzels and beer and chocolate. It was not a healthy year, but it was fun.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Now probably Spain is the well known for this. It's mostly like enjoys fame more than any other place in Europe.

    Barcelona, for example, or south of France or like Nice. And those are, it's beautiful there too. Yeah, super fun.

Jennifer Roberge

    Those are nice cities. Yeah.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Cool. Awesome. Yeah. We'll bring it back to Montreal then. Are you from Montreal?

Jennifer Roberge

    No, I'm an American, but my, I'm at my husband in the US and he's from here. So we live here and.

    Yeah, we live in Montreal. It's really cold, but it's okay. It's a nice city.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Are you finding that people that can be co-op people? Mm.

Jennifer Roberge

    Mixed. I don't speak French, so that's the problem. Yeah, it's a sensitive point. Mixed, but Montreal is great. Quebec is less great, in my opinion.

    Montreal is very diverse and very.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Have you met any Tunisian people in Montreal?

Jennifer Roberge

    No, I have not.

Ahmed Jemaa

    OK, that's good. Yeah.

Jennifer Roberge

    Is there a big community here that you know of?

Ahmed Jemaa

    Yeah, I think so.

Jennifer Roberge

    Yeah. I've got a lot of Colombians and a lot of like Syrians. A lot, a lot, a lot of Haitians.

    That's like probably and a lot of Portuguese and Italian. Those are like the ethnic groups.

Ahmed Jemaa

    They're a Francophone country. So actually there must be a lot of. I mean, I'm aware there are a lot of Tunisians.

    You go there and study in Haiti, It's a very famous kind of, I think, not a business goal, but like finance, whatever, marketing, but yeah, whatever.

    Interesting, yeah, no, I'm surprised.

Jennifer Roberge

    Anyway, I don't know if whatever reason our circles have been crossed.

Ahmed Jemaa

    But where are we from from the US then?

Jennifer Roberge

    We moved from Atlanta was the last place that North Carolina and Texas and yeah, true American moving around.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Red States, red States?

Jennifer Roberge

    Unfortunately. A blue girl and a red state.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Yeah, I mean, yeah, I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna, I still like to do this, but yeah, I'm not, yeah, I have mixed opinions about both.

    So if there is a violet state, I would probably go for that.

Jennifer Roberge

    Yeah, it's a shame. Because I find like, yeah, a lot of the red states are really beautiful, lovely states if you take out like the racial inequality and like just so many other things, but it's okay.

    My friends in those states are good people.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Yeah, at least, I mean, yeah, you don't have to like the house. See, I need to know.

Jennifer Roberge

    Exactly.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Go, go, go, go. Oh, let's get this. Now, let me go to the website. So you see the company.

    Um, yeah. So why, I mean, why are we talking today? Is that?

Jennifer Roberge

    Um, yeah. So my company is 11 years old. We started on MailChamp, migrated to Clavio when that became a thing because we're, we're old enough that Clavio wasn't even around back then.

SCREEN SHARING
Ahmed started screen sharing

    So we moved and then, um, I have a like marketing director that manages my strategy and, um, and a whole host of things, whatever, but she's not a, she's more of a generalist and not specific, uh, and any, not an expert in any really one thing.

    She is now, but it's not. Anyway, it's not email and she's been managed my email. I think for a time when we first moved and we

    We were making changes after that, after we moved from Clavio to Clavio. And things were OK. Like we were getting probably 30% of our revenue from email.

    And over the past few years, and really the past year, it's just tanked. We're down to 10%. And I noticed the other day I logged in.

    And this has been happening slowly. So I don't really know. But I did notice the other day I logged in and checked out our bounce rate and spam rate spiked in July for this account and another one.

    So that was really weird. They're not on the same email servers and stuff. We stopped Facebook marketing around that time.

    So that's the only common denominator that I can think of.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Why did you service with marketing?

Jennifer Roberge

    Cheers. We were just horrible. We were getting horrible results. So we're looking for another group. Somebody knew to manage that for us.

    But we're taking a break. So yeah. That's why it's just we have so much potential and it's just a shame that it's gone to this point.

    But that's okay. That made me realize that I don't need, I don't want my marketing person doing this anymore.

    I need somebody who's like an expert in it to man it to audit and get everything set up the way it should be, fix everything, add new things, new flows.

    Even our campaigns are just not doing super well anymore. Like nothing is doing great anymore. And then I want someone to manage it on an ongoing basis.

    Like kind of I just need reporting. I need reporting and I need to be kept at the speed about new things or new things to try and how things are looking and that kind of thing.

Ahmed Jemaa

    So if you would pick one category for your brand, where should it go? Or like because I see here, you're offering a lot of stuff.

Jennifer Roberge

    Yeah. Ah, you could go do it. Oh, are you going to natural skincare? That's fine.

Ahmed Jemaa

    So are these the what are the best salaries for website?

Jennifer Roberge

    That first one is the first one that on the left, the Yoro minute. Yeah, that's actually my own brand.

    So one of the other email, one of the other accounts is the Yoro Naturals account for email that needs to be cleaned up.

    We have a separate website. So that is the best seller. And yeah. So one of the premises, so I started this company as my son had really, really severe eczema and we found like he did well healed with like natural like holistic kind of like health and eating better and clean skincare and things like that.

    And that's why I started this brand like it was really hard as a mother to find like the right solution.

    him and when we finally did, I wanted to share, you know, all everything to make it easier for parents because it's a nightmare.

    Now we're beyond just parents, but it is a nightmare when you see your child suffering and you're just desperate to help them.

    And so the idea was to provide, because when you have eczema, not one, there isn't one thing that can help.

    Everyone's skin is really different. There's no miracle product out there. So the idea was to provide natural things with clean ingredients.

    They can trust my store because everything we have is super clean. You could pretty much eat anything you see on the site.

    And so it's safe, it's clean, but they need to try a few different things to get to the right answer.

    Like you could try our best seller. That's usually like the place I said, and people just start with. And if that doesn't work, we have other things.

    Chinese medicine, Western herbs, we have creams with different ingredients. Maybe they react to something and they need a different something without that one ingredient.

    And we have different solutions we have clothing. and things like that. And so it's frustrating because that was why it was created, but we just don't get those repeat customers.

    Our repeat rate is really bad. I don't remember what it is, but it's abysmal. And we tried through email, we've tried with a little two programs, and I just don't feel like anything.

    We were able to do a good job of it. So we're missing those repeat customers. We have some flow set up, but I feel like we really need to figure out how to get those specific people back that tried something and it didn't work, or they didn't like it for some reason, and get them back to try something else.

    That's the key. That's the major key that's missing.

Ahmed Jemaa

    There's tons of other things to work on, but that is fine tuning that will be the answer to my business, I think.

    Cool. No, that's a very thorough elaborate answer. I mean, hey, helpful. No, I'm curious. Do you have your account live?

    right now, like we could open it and we can go over it together.

Jennifer Roberge

    Yep.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Yeah, let's do that.

Jennifer Roberge

    Share my screen. You need to stop sharing. Where are where's my Clavio account? I have it open. Hold on one sec.

SCREEN SHARING
Jennifer started screen sharing

    There we go. Yeah. As you can see.

Ahmed Jemaa

    I can use them a little bit.

Jennifer Roberge

    Yeah.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Okay. I don't want to make it. It's a small screen. Probably as a part of sharing you. You have a small screen or.

Jennifer Roberge

    No, I'm on a laptop. So it's not super huge.

Ahmed Jemaa

    I was on a laptop, but. Like it's a bit odd because usually it covers the whole screen in my end right now.

    It covers probably. 13 inches or 12 inches. I don't know. It's fine. Oh, good. I'm not sure. I'm not sure.

    Okay. So, um, I see. Okay. Okay. Can you. Let's go up. I need to see the dashboard members. Yeah.

    So 11% from clavio, 6% from flows, 5% from campaigns. Okay. So we can. The goal is to get it to 15, 15, at least.

    So overall, it's 30. Um, usually as they say in clavio's training, you want to aim at 50 50 split between campaigns and flows.

    If you don't have that split, you can optimize the site. Okay, let's let me see one of your flows.

    Let's go for the welcome series non-patrices. I want to see the. Yeah, how it looks like just to get a sense of like.

    How sophisticated it is. So can you. Okay, so it's not turned on with the manual thing. It's it means like it has been edited.

    Oh, yeah, so yeah, we just started SMS.

Jennifer Roberge

    Yeah, with attentive yesterday or two days ago and. So we're using their their. Oh, wait, why is this turned off?

    Oh, because that's the SMS part. Yeah. Okay. Here you go. Here's the.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Do you need a tent is actually.

Jennifer Roberge

    I'm trying it. It was good. They set it up. It was free. It's a free 30 day thing.

Ahmed Jemaa

    I'm trying. I don't know. We're going to try. So, I mean, I know they're they're free. I mean, I'm partnered with them so I can refer them business.

    But I. don't because first they're pretty aggressive with their pricing. Second, especially for US-based clients, I mean, actually, they're only US-based, attentive as I know, is and postscript as well, their competitor.

    They're all like North America kind of solutions. And yeah, there's no need for them because Kalevio actually rolled out SMS last year.

    And now you could have SMS done through Kalevio and actually it's much cheaper than these alternatives.

Jennifer Roberge

    Yeah, but I don't have you been running campaigns in here in Kalevio for SMS for people? Yes.

Ahmed Jemaa

    And how are your results? I mean, there are a few features in attentive that are not in Kalevio, but overall, I think it would make much more sense for you to collect everything in one place and have everything in one source of truth.

    And efficiently or in a more efficient way than to have. have two solutions and manage things in two different solutions.

    And the thing is, for example, as a part of the flow setup that we do, I can show it in a moment.

    We combine an email and SMS together in the same kind of flow. And so there's well orchestrated if that would, that makes sense.

    They're not like set up separately like they are right now. And so right now there's a lot of room for overlap.

    There's a lot of room for, yeah, messages being confusing or being sent at the same time from different channels.

    I mean, it's not like you can't organize it, but it's much more complicated work.

Jennifer Roberge

    Yeah, no, that's interesting. You're the first, I've been meeting with a few people and you're the first person to say that.

    That's interesting, it's a good point. And yeah, I tend to, so I'm on big commerce. So I have to use a tentive.

    They're like the only one that integrates with big commerce. And yeah, I mean, we just turned it on. We're gonna see so far there.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Okay, yeah, so far their option rate is way higher than mine.

Jennifer Roberge

    Clovio and maybe it was that was bad.

Ahmed Jemaa

    I don't know. I'm actually curious. Was that the pop up that I've seen on the site?

Jennifer Roberge

    You're international so it should have been site turn it only wouldn't we wouldn't pop up for you international? I think that was the clovio one it was Well, I can show you but you should have that's actually a good thing to check Let me go check.

Ahmed Jemaa

    I mean, I've seen a pop up, but it was not like super great I would not expect more than 1% that's exactly what we were getting.

    So let's see.

Jennifer Roberge

    It's probably the clovio one. I Hope so because that's what I did the other day.

Ahmed Jemaa

    I went in I went in to remove everybody The sign up forms not Nothing the list I usually get to it actually from the list and then I went into newsletter and then it anyway I can do it here too You're on desktop or mobile desktop, so yeah

Jennifer Roberge

    Um, it is. Back.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Yeah, this one. Yeah.

Jennifer Roberge

    That's so weird. We used to have a picture on there. I don't know what happened. Anyway.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Yeah. When, when was that?

Jennifer Roberge

    I don't know.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Okay. No, it's so yeah. We'll take care of everything. No way. Okay. So let me see the, yeah, actually the first, we were checking the first flow.

    So let's go back to the first slow. Welcome series. Uh, non buyers. I think you had on the home.

    So go back to home and then open it up there. So faster. Yes. Mm.

Jennifer Roberge

    Welcome.

Ahmed Jemaa

    You want to go back in there? Yeah. First one. Yeah. Exit.

Jennifer Roberge

    This one is where, so we give our. Yeah. our coupon. Well, yeah, our coupon goes in. Yeah, that's where you get the coupon.

    We don't provide it until you get the email.

Ahmed Jemaa

    So that's why we have a high rate. You. Yeah, Hey, a review.

Jennifer Roberge

    Oops. Sorry.

Ahmed Jemaa

    No, click on it. Yeah. Mm, scroll down. Yeah. So. Yeah, there's a lot of room for improvement. I mean, we're here for that.

Jennifer Roberge

    So she just changed it. It was, I thought it was better before she was A.B. testing. And we weren't seeing much better results.

    So it's not that much better than the other one. But yeah. Yeah, there's a lot of room.

Ahmed Jemaa

    OK, what else? Let's see. Can you go back?

Jennifer Roberge

    This is more of what the form used to look like, something more like that. She changed to the bed.

    OK, where am I going?

Ahmed Jemaa

    Can you hit show? analytics on the top and the mini bar that's showing out it's yep so open rate is 39 that should be higher on the welcome series and you could aim at 50 something in the welcome series and I see a lot of people are being skipped so I need to investigate that you have thousands that are being skipped I know I always asked about why and I've never got an answer from my person so yeah yeah I mean yeah so if some people if certain emails are not correct so those get skipped if they end up for example like engaging with other flows so let's say they have actually if they first the emails are there already that's I mean some some flows.

    pop up after in the rules of the flows you could set up like hey pop up every 30 days for that specific person and so sometimes clap you doesn't know that the person is the part of the email list already that if they subscribe again they would not it's double subscribe so they would skip the flow there's also the potential of the the skip thing I think it has also something to do with the web tracking sometimes clap it doesn't actually yeah I need to check the rules of this but as far as I remember I think it's it's not for the welcome series it's usually for the abandoned cart or the brows abandoned so some of those emails get figured out by clap you without people inputting

    them without people typing them and the pop-up form and those have a higher rate of being wrong and that's why they get it.

    But again, this is to be investigated. We'll keep it to another day. But for now, let me check the campaigns quickly.

    In terms of the flows, actually, so you only have six or seven and they're focused on... Okay, let's check the campaigns first.

    24th, let's check the last one.

Jennifer Roberge

    We need used to be like thousands of dollars. Yeah, that's kind of sad. So we boost. So yeah, so we send one and then we attest to time and all that.

    So we send it Monday night at like eight and then we send a boost on Wednesday at 10 and that is basically sending the same email with a different subject line to people that did not open email.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Yeah. Yeah, the recent, yeah.

Jennifer Roberge

    And I wanted to make. Yeah, we want to make that automated, but apparently there's no way and it's super, super annoying and easy to fit in.

Ahmed Jemaa

    But you change it, right? You change the email. You don't send the same email.

Jennifer Roberge

    We send the same email with a different subject line to people that did not open.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Yeah. Okay.

Jennifer Roberge

    Hoping the new subject line will entice them to open it.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Yeah, it's very hard to automate this and you can't automate this. But yeah, I mean, we do that, especially we're, yeah, we have it as a plan for black players, I don't remember the clients, but anyway, so, all right.

    Good idea. It's not bad idea. So, um, can you click on one campaign? So by the way, the open rate is fine on the campaign side of things.

    So we will check in a moment, the engagement rate of your list. But so far so good. Um, okay.

    Review campaign. Conversion rate is pretty low. So open rate is pretty high or okay. The credit is pretty low.

    It's pretty low, very hot. Oh yeah, the campaigns are not not good looking so good.

Jennifer Roberge

    My feelings are not hurt, I understand. Yeah. That's why we're here.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Yeah, it's fine. Hey, we're analyzing things or so yeah, the click rate should be yeah, five to 10 percent.

    Um, actually wait, the operate, yeah, your operate could be improved to 40, 40 percent, but again, it depends on the list that you're sending to.

    Um, here is, are you sending just to engage in the last 30 days or 60 days or every month?

Jennifer Roberge

    Oh no, right now we're sending to the whole newsletter left, but my, we were for a while testing sending to like more engaged people and the numbers we even were.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Okay, okay, let's go to the list and send minutes quickly. I'm curious to see how engaged your list is.

    Go to the largest list that you have. Yep. And then reports. And then generate engagement. Yep. And generic report.

    Ah, here you go. It's already generated. Okay.

Jennifer Roberge

    Up on the red part. Yeah, big red part.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Up on it. You'll see the numbers. Yeah, 69% are not engaged. So almost if there's a few less are not engaged.

    And that's, that's pretty well. Um, I've been worth. So it's fine. This could be approved over time. There are ways to improve this.

    One way could be to, of course, like there's the email side of things, but there's also the aid ad side.

    I think I'm not sure if you're running Google ad or I mean you said it's official. Okay, you're running Google ads.

    So it is quite quite new and new integration between Clavio and Google ads. And so now you could export this list to Google ads.

    You could ask your Google ads manager to make the connection between or the integration between Clavio and Google ads.

    And basically, you will be sinking your, you know, list into your Google ads account. And they will be able to run remarketing or targeting campaigns to existing subscribers.

    In this case, mostly and engaged subscribers to reengage them again.

Jennifer Roberge

    We are doing retargeting. But I think it's through like the big commerce feed. Yeah, I mean, but Clavio think it's better.

Ahmed Jemaa

    I mean, those people subscribe and stop engaging for so long. And so they're not a part of your retargeting on the website.

    They're not a similar website. So you're a point. Yeah.

Jennifer Roberge

    Yeah. What's interesting is like how I do have like maybe like three to five weeks. I have a a decent time period to engage them.

    And then after that, they're just not interested anymore.

Ahmed Jemaa

    So this is per AC, the member age. So the x acts, which is the member age. And then the y acts shows the engagement distribution.

    And so over the older the member, the less engaged they are.

Jennifer Roberge

    Yeah, totally. So that's, yeah. And we clean our list. So I think it's at 90 days. If they don't open emails like three times or four times in a row, we remove them.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Yes. So we have it.

Jennifer Roberge

    OK, let's set up.

Ahmed Jemaa

    You have a sunset slower, so.

Jennifer Roberge

    Yeah, but like this, honestly, we should. Well, yeah, that's enough flow.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Yeah. OK, I mean, that's good. All right, we only have I have a call.

Jennifer Roberge

    I think I have a call. Let me check at 1130. So oh, no, no, no. I actually, oh, wow, you're in luck.

    I have till 12.

Ahmed Jemaa

    So all this shit like under is to have a counter center to this. And then my friends need to knock me.

    OK, you're not living. Yeah.

Jennifer Roberge

    Why?

Ahmed Jemaa

    To kind of like to deplete all my energy like calls. I mean, I could only have three of these and actually, yeah, nature of my work right now is that same with me.

Jennifer Roberge

    No, same with me, but this week is super busy because I'm trying to find. I want to find someone and decide by tomorrow and then start on Monday with email.

    So like I'm, I've been meeting with a lot of people.

Ahmed Jemaa

    It's not usually like this. You don't have to meet any other people.

Jennifer Roberge

    That's competent. Okay, so what do we do now?

Ahmed Jemaa

    He's paying the contract. No, um, let's go to. So we check the flows, we check the campaign for you.

    Let's check the benchmarks. Go down and I'll text. Yeah, let's go to benchmarks. Yeah. Okay. So let's go down.

    Yeah. Okay, so. Average value is 80 bucks. Okay. Quick rate is 21. Okay. On the abandoned. Okay. Abandoned flows.

    So, as expected. But I'm performing metrics. Pretty high. That's the tech. Yeah. On the welcome. That's actually, yeah. Also, in line or aligned with my assumption that they have to skip a lot of photos because they bounce and so for those who were not flagged.

    I have. Dounceable email. They don't bounce and the. And welcome, but it's fine. Okay. You also have a pretty high return.

    What are we trying to write.

Jennifer Roberge

    Hold on real quick. You're, you've been a bit muffled this whole time and sometimes I'm having our time understanding you.

    Do you have your microphone or are you on speaker or what is it? Something's muffled.

Ahmed Jemaa

    I'm going to. So yeah, I'm seeing the headset. It worked fine in the previous call. I think you have any concerns about the quality.

    Probably I was putting my hand on the mic. I don't know. Is it better now?

Jennifer Roberge

    No? I don't know. A little bit, maybe. I'm not sure.

Ahmed Jemaa

    OK. That's interesting.

Jennifer Roberge

    Are you really close to the mic? Like, is it right in your?

Ahmed Jemaa

    I'm using a headset. OK. So it's with no.

Jennifer Roberge

    OK, well, if I don't understand, I'll just ask you to repeat.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Apologies. Anyway, so can you check the campaign set of things? Can you click on campaigns there?

Jennifer Roberge

    We're up here.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Where? This. Both work, actually. Yeah. OK, so for the campaign set of things, yeah, the click rate is easy.

    I told you earlier, the click rate is fit. Oh, yeah. It is justified here. Place order rate. I mean, if the click rate is low, yeah, you can leave the current rate for the place order rate is all.

    So that's expected. And you scroll down to the delivery part. Yeah, so poor bounce rate. High is a complaint straight and.

    Good enough or good. Okay, cool. Yeah, so we need to do some work on the bounce rates of things.

    We need to clean the list. Because you're getting a lot of bounces on the email side of things. So also you need to check your process on cleansing the list and make sure that that's working well.

    As I see so far, you have a lot of engaged users receiving emails and on top of that, you get a lot of bounces and unsubscribe so that's a signal that.

    Yeah. Those emails are not necessarily will come by receiving. Let's check the close now. The benchmarks for the flows.

    Is my audio.

Jennifer Roberge

    Still not very clear. Yeah, I think no, it's better. I think part of the problem was I had the volume higher for some reason and so it was like it was getting distorted a little bit.

    I think it was on my end actually. So it's better now I lowered the volume. Yeah.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Yeah, yeah, flows open rate. So it's 27 on average across all the flows. Yeah, this could be better. I told you earlier that the welcome series was at 30 something and it should be 50 something.

    Especially that welcome series. The other ones could have a low open rate but the welcome series usually if the incentive is attractive enough for just enough people will have to open the email and usually that leads to 60% operate.

    So bounce rates again complete rates are yeah. Yeah, showing here again so we need to look into that. Cool.

    Let's go to Senate forms. We want to. aim at six seven on average to the industry had two three percent.

    Yeah, so okay, so can you select the one with the most data? I think this one doesn't have that much data.

Jennifer Roberge

    So it's been this because it's off.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Yeah, the line. Yeah, so the median is 3.5. You see?

Jennifer Roberge

    Yeah.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Okay. Cool. I'm actually curious which niche you picked in Clavia. So like what's the category that you're in? Your account.

    You know what that is?

Jennifer Roberge

    It would either be your health health and you're okay.

Ahmed Jemaa

    I see it in the industry. Yep. I want cool, cool, cool. So you're the value. So 27% to the campaign.

    Wait, how often do some campaigns?

Jennifer Roberge

    Sorry. How often campaigns are twice a week because it's one the first time the one email a week and then we bounce it or whatever you recent.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Okay, so like two a week, I guess. Okay, right. Yeah, one actual email a week. Yes. Okay. I have a good time value.

    I see 30 bucks here, but I've seen earlier 80 bucks average value.

Jennifer Roberge

    This is item value, not order value.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Ah, sorry. That's a good catch there. Okay. You're afraid minus 30. Okay, 83% minus rate.

Jennifer Roberge

    Yeah, but so are the peers negative.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Yeah, yeah. It's crazy. Okay. Rave me for months. Okay. Okay. Okay. Cool, cool. Cool. Um, let's, um, so we check the engagement, we check the analytics, we check the, okay.

    I think we covered more some important parts. I have to look also, I had to look at the designs and the content of the email.

    So I think I have a good idea, um, what we currently have. Let's have a look at my, actually, let's check the flows quickly.

    The flows that you can really have go to, or actually go to home, go to home, home home home home home home home home home can show it better.

    So in home. Yep, performance. Can you scroll down. We have. Well, from series, Bros. I think that's the first time I've ever seen a lot of customers.

    I think that's the first time I've ever seen a lot of customers. I don't know what that is. Is that flow or can I find key plots September.

Jennifer Roberge

    Oh, that was a terrible idea. That was we, we did this big sweepstakes program and they could opt in if they wanted to.

    And yeah, it was bad. So that's a one time thing.

Ahmed Jemaa

    It's still live in the way. I mean, it's green. So probably you want to turn it off. But then customer cities first time buyers at risk.

    That's a series. Yeah, I think. Yeah. It's probably a post purchase for repeat buyers. Okay. I mean, you could combine the third and the sixth one together, the repeat buyer and the current buyer would branch in the mouth depending on the order count.

    And then there's a broad environment and purchases versus purchasers. You could also branch them out together in the same email.

    And then you had negative reviews. Let's try right now.

Jennifer Roberge

    The abandoned cart were running in big commerce. So are you familiar with big commerce? Like how it works with Clavio?

Ahmed Jemaa

    Yes, we have integrations with big commerce. Okay. We use them. Okay.

Jennifer Roberge

    So when we first set up with Clavio, we thought about setting up a abandoned cart in Clavio, but we'd been running it from big commerce forever.

    And we didn't because there was a, they told us at the time that, or we did, we tried it in the rates, it was just terrible.

    And they told us that the reason, or Clavio told us. They didn't have a super great integration with the commerce on that because I guess they had to be on a newsletter list, I think, or.

    Clove you have had to have captured their email already to send them an abandoned cart and then big commerce when we send it from the commerce as long as they start putting their email in the checkout, then they can email them, you know.

    So there was like a disconnect and we were getting better results with the commerce. I don't know if it's still the case or how it works, but it makes sense.

    I don't know if it's still that way.

Ahmed Jemaa

    So I think, yeah, we're sending those with Clove here so far. I mean, we usually export the, no, actually, we send them through who commerce are or be commerce in your case, but we still have them on brand.

    Yeah, they're not good right now and become our sir pretty ugly.

Jennifer Roberge

    I was going to sign into attentive to.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Yeah, that's not a big, that's not a problem, I guess. Cool, cool. Yeah, so let me know. You could subscribe screen.

    I can. The framework that we have. So yeah, I see you have you. You covered for the flows. I'm going to go over the list that I have.

    I'm going to show it to me right now.

Jennifer Roberge

    Okay.

SCREEN SHARING
Ahmed started screen sharing
SCREEN SHARING
Ahmed started screen sharing

    Okay. So we usually have. I'm not sure. Did you check my website by the way?

Jennifer Roberge

    I don't think so.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Cool. So basically this is our website. It's pretty straightforward. So explains the services that we have. Like, yeah, the challenge that we work on.

    What you should expect when working with us input output and outcome. And the plans that we offer. Some reviews, some.

    Some decimals. The services will explain. You can check it out later. Just do not.

Jennifer Roberge

    Do you focus on marketing? I went on email or are you more like a full retention?

Ahmed Jemaa

    Retention. Retention solutions. Oh, yeah. Yeah. It's created for some email. And we have also the pricing plans. There. I also explained.

    Yeah, we have usually two phases phase one, which is the retention set up, which is the close. Then up the flows.

    And making sure that deliverability sort it out. So set up the little ability and also set up the list growth kind of initiatives, which are basically improving the pop up and making sure in your case, you want to have two step up.

    Right now you have two different pop ups. One from. You each app, like one from Klivion, one from attentive, ideally you want to have a two step helpful.

Jennifer Roberge

    Or two steps like oh for email and FMF.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Yeah, that's how it is. Yeah, and yeah, you I mean on average we're averaging like 7% or so, 10% right on those.

    You could have more if you have a bit of offer. And then yeah, the face to the ongoing management of the campaigns.

    I mean we could we could combine both but most of our clients prefer to go with this one, and then see and then go with face to which is the ongoing management.

    This is a one time off thing. Usually takes three to four weeks to get done with this phase one.

    And then the ongoing management, this is a monthly thing so you could subscribe to monthly or quarterly or yearly.

    And of course there are incentives for going with yearly or quarterly. And then of course deliverable as I was.

    I'll explain here. So, and the ongoing measurement to do campaigns, you know, an SSS as you can see, and then have also initiatives on this growth, maybe testing, testing offers, deliberately segmentation reporting.

    Anyway, so that's a brief thing, you can check it later to have a better idea of how we operate.

    But I wanted to touch on this because we have, as you can see, three plans for the phase one, which I assume you're going to probably proceed with.

    I mean, from my experience and per what you've shown me so far, it seems like this could be a good start for you.

    And depending on the plan that you're like, yeah, the revenue range usually that's pretty reliable recommendation. Yeah, I'm in the middle.

    Yeah. And I'm just to tell you most people 80% of our clients go with the middle. The other 20% 50% of them 50% of them go with a scale and probably 5% go with activities for absolutely beginners that sound from.

    zero and we don't have that many of those clients so we must our clients go to retain it's yeah the most value for your money I would say and so yeah based of that we segmented these three frameworks as you can see here so you have the activity to retain and scale I'm gonna go over to retain quickly the scale has a lot more nice to have low not a lot more like before there's the price drop flow like you every day so I don't think that's absolutely necessary but some brands want it so that's why we give it there's the cycle I'm losing you you're breaking up pause pause pause you're breaking up I can't hear you super well

    Okay, probably I should you're active the other place. I also need to charge like a computer. Can you hear me?

Jennifer Roberge

    Yeah, yeah, no, that's fine. Yeah.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Okay, if it breaks again, we'll have to move a little bit, but it's fine. The fact of a category of abandonment is a lower intent low compared to the browser abandonment, which I think you currently have.

    But right now what you're doing is, thank you. Double. You're breaking up again. Okay, let me move a little bit and get closer to the.

    Okay, yeah, so. I'm not sure. Have you ever seen the site or category abandonment as well?

Jennifer Roberge

    Which one?

Ahmed Jemaa

    Excuse me ate.

Jennifer Roberge

    flow.

Ahmed Jemaa

    No. Okay. So basically, this is one visits a certain category of your website and abundance. And actually, in your case, it's probably an important use case because you have a lot of categories on your website, but you have a lot of products with a lot of different categories.

    Correct? Yep. Yeah. So what we can offer them is, depending on which category they visited, so if they visited the category and they didn't visit the product page, you can follow up with them with products from that specific category.

    So it's dynamic and it's a more personalized follow-up. And again, if they don't add to cart, if they don't visit any product, you can follow up with them with a category specific.

Jennifer Roberge

    Yeah, no, that's interesting. Well, what would, so like, I need to, but like I was telling you, like that does, that's great.

    I think there's a lot of cool flow that could be set up, but I think the key is how to find those.

    the first time buyers that aren't coming back for the second third purchase because they're scared.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Oh, no, no, no, this is not a first time buyer. This is, so there's something you need to be around and actually, so there's something called Web Tracking.

    Do you have it set up?

Jennifer Roberge

    Pretty sure, probably.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Yeah, so Web Tracking does get those people yeah, to get into these emails. So the trigger is active on site.

    It's not like subscribed to your newsletter.

Jennifer Roberge

    Oh, this is okay. This is a round of the band.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Yes, bros and category bandmen all these things. So they don't have to be subscribed to actually get sent into this flow.

Jennifer Roberge

    Yeah, no, those are cool. Those would be more interesting because you're really focusing on what they were interested in.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Yeah. Right, so yeah, but yeah, just to kind of briefly go through the pre-purchase. So you have a pop-up flow that's straightforward, although it's more focused on the building.

    actually you have a nice story to tell, like how your your son was suffering and you have how you figured out like you found a solution and then you tried to kind of share it with others.

    So that's a really nice story that they could empathize with and relate to. So that needs to be shared in the onboarding or in the email about flow here.

    And so yeah, we shared that the founding story, the mission, the vision, the values of the brand, we need to kind of nail those because those builds actually the connection with your potential customers.

    Then testimonials, which you have many of them, and then reminders here for the incentive that they subscribe for. And you can see here also there's this put between email and SMS though, if it's SMS and they also receive a couple of other pull-ups here.

    Okay. And then abandon check out, this is yeah, when they appreciate the check on don't proceed. So SMS pull-ups and then email pull-ups and here depending on whether they've been in this flow before in the past or not, if they've been, then it ends there.

    If not, then there's... conditional split depending on whether they use the pop-up flow discount or not, we don't want to give away discounts while they don't use them.

    And so if they've used it, then it stops here. If not, then sorry, they receive the follow-ups without a discount.

    If they haven't received it, then they receive the follow-ups with incentive. And in this case, you could see based on the cart value.

    So we offer them a discount. Let's say if they left in the cart, I don't know, $100 worth of products, then they receive probably a stronger discount than or a higher discount than when they abandon, let's say, $20.

    So basically, we will play the number, the X here. But yeah, we make it dynamic. So that's the abandoned checkout.

    Then there's the cart abandonment, some more stuff here in terms of the conditional split. Basically, if they viewed a product more than

    three times then that gets re-emphasized on in the email pull-ups dynamically of course, if not then yeah they get randomly selected usually best sellers shown to them because again browser bandwidth is about visiting a product page, one product page and so yeah then we have the back-end stock which is also quite important.

    I think we're using NSTOCK notify which is an app but we could it could be nice to if there was a free one if the free one works because you know we pay extra for the other app so yeah we could look into that we usually have like a after ship like the app that the like most our clients is but we could look into the app that you're using and see if there's an actual need for it yeah okay and then post purchase this is I would say probably also straightforward although in your case you have I think two or three different ones yeah basically the post purchase here depending.

    on the order count. You can see because you had like first time repeat customers and first time customers. In our case, we're going to have first split to based off the channel that they're going to like if they're subscribed for SMS they're going to receive all SMS communications.

    If not, just email and if just email them depending on the order count, you can see here conditions split order count.

    If it's the first time then they see this type of email. If it's the second time there's these type of emails.

    If it's the third time then you could introduce the loyalty or the IP or which you currently have I guess.

Jennifer Roberge

    Hold on one sec. I was going to say like we only have 10 minutes left. So before I have to go so I see that you guys have all these like flows that are kind of plug and play which are cool and then you just make sure the branding and the content is like on par with.

    So that's really cool. Yeah but I wanted to know yeah I guess that's part of it. I wanted to know about your content and your your design.

    I wanted to know about your reporting and Um, what else there was something else. Yeah, no, I guess that's it.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Oh, so in terms of design, so actually. What is it called journey? Okay, cool. So in terms of the template, so I'll show you this link in the follow up email and you will be able to see a bunch of templates that created for clients in the past.

    Uh, I'll show why they're not loading the rest. Uh, I hear you go. So actually we have, uh, we have pretty close to you.

    Then it is old. Uh, yeah, this one. I'm back in stock. Okay. Let us that. Yeah. So this is.

    Yeah. I forgot what it was for. But yeah, not on chain. This is jewelry. Um, but yeah, they're not very relevant to the jewelry part.

    Yeah, we have the acne part here. Yeah, this part, this part of aesthetics. So this is how the design should look like.

    And again, we have endless provisions for. So if you don't like something, you've always asked what to be realized and improve.

    It doesn't matter what I like.

Jennifer Roberge

    It needs to be what the customer's like.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Well, I mean, actually a question that we asked as a public onboarding. Hey, rank in terms of priorities, what you like for, like, what are your priorities?

    And we show you like branding and performance and your personal opinion and like stuff like that. And then we would know what are your priorities because like, if you think your personal opinion matters more than like the branding of your company or the performance, then we will follow that.

    Right. It's very important for us to know what, what's your preferences or your preferences are. Anyway, so the designs are there.

    The onboarding or sorry, the process for this to get the designs done properly. As a part of the onboarding, what we do is we show you a library of templates.

    So let's go here. Let's go quickly here. I know we're, I don't have that much time. You have skincare.

    Yeah, you have skincare here. So basically you'll get shown this category and these are all the designs from very famous brands of space.

    And you'll be picking what you like and what you don't like from headers to footers to the way they show their icons, the way they show their testimonials, the way they display their products, the way they structure the thing, the way they play with the contrast and so on and so forth.

    And so based of your taste and your opinion on these templates, we'll be asking the designer to replicate them.

    Like. I, I, I. It's much easier to ask the disaster to replicate things than to creatively come up with something that you don't really know.

Jennifer Roberge

    And these are like proven that are they're good and they're clean and they work well.

Ahmed Jemaa

    And yes, so these are like selected from actually there's a website called really beautiful, beautiful designs or really, really good email design or something.

    And we build this from from that thing to our food library is not just one. And yeah, they're famous tools like it's like how to call them.

    Repository or swipe files that a lot of designers use. And so we built them internally and we have them now numbered and basically as a part of the onboarding, we will ask you to pick what you like and wait.

    And like, again, there's a branding part and there's the best practices part. Of course, we will tell you as a part of also the kickoff call that, hey, if you want to do this design, hey, this will come at the cost of this performance thing or.

    Hey, these things don't work really well. all together and we need to make it compromised and so on and so forth.

    So we will be also like asking you questions and trying to get the underlying reason behind you picking those designs to that.

    And by the way, the call, the kickoff call will be recorded and we will be shared with the designer and the designer will have an idea of how we think about your choices.

    Yeah, that's the design part. Now in terms of the onboarding questions and copy part to make sure that it's on brand and it's not missing the nuances that you want to communicate with the copy.

    So we have a very thorough onboarding process like forms that you need to fill out. And yeah, I mean, I think I've almost everything.

    I mean, it takes only one hour and a half, I would say. We had a client's complaint about the length of it, I'm honest.

    But it's so. Depending on the use of with it because you do it only once and then we don't have to take that much input from you anymore.

    And yeah, there's, they won't be upcoming like, reoccurring revisions because we then take the right input in the beginning or get go.

    And so yeah, we ask you all the questions by the audience, you can see age, languages, education, economic status, relationship status, a bunch of questions regarding copy.

    So like the biases they have, like the trends that are occurring in their lives, frustrations, which actually your product, well, you have a lot of content to share here.

    The founding date, on X-story.

Jennifer Roberge

    Okay. Yeah. Okay, let's move to reporting because we only have three minutes now.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Yeah, so in regards to reporting, actually, you have it here. So I'll show you this link later. It's going to show you how it explains actually a lot of things that I already did.

    They're recorded in videos that you can watch on demon later. There's also some testimonials of clients. Some also, they said it's recorded and then there's reports.

    So the reports are, so the way we report actually also on the website, we have how it works and explain also how we report.

    So this is kind of the way we operate internally. I don't think you hear that much about that, but this is the art that is.

    Yeah, in terms of communication. So we have why we take calls. And the project is going to be managed transparently in click up.

    I'm not sure if you ever use to click up. We ever know. Okay, so it's similar to. It's similar to like a son or.

Jennifer Roberge

    Okay, yeah.

Ahmed Jemaa

    And yeah, it has some combined style type of dashboard and also have a chat feature. So everything you'll be clearly tracked and seen and just built the scene over.

    Basically, let me show it to you. So by monthly meetings, you said, by weekly, by weekly. So every two weeks, not every week, every two weeks.

    So this is the internal. So we have a lot of internal things here and the shared client. So on your end, you'll be seen tickets like this being worked on.

    And also you'll be seen dashboards like this. For example, this one, where you see the notes from the onboard and deck.

    For example, the chat feature here discussing things and us assigning you like, for example, if you wanted to improve things will assign them to you here and then you will.

    Yeah, approve them and check them. So this is straightforward. We have also a short video explaining how to use this.

    So it shouldn't be as sophisticated. Now, other than that, on a monthly basis, we can generate these reports for you, which I believe you probably haven't seen them in the past.

    If you haven't worked with an agency. So. If you worked with just a designer, sorry, project manager, I believe you probably haven't seen those, but clearly allows us as partners to generate these very total reports.

    Basically, yeah, like this, showing you that's quarterly. That's monthly.

Jennifer Roberge

    Okay.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Yeah, so monthly basis, you'll see the performance, literally everything we've done through in terms of analytics will be put in here before flow campaign for campaign.

    So it's pretty straightforward. Actually, I'll show to this. The benchmarks. How well you're doing compared to your peer group list growth, how well we're doing low revenue, all closed metric, all that stuff.

    This will be shared to you on a monthly basis.

Jennifer Roberge

    Okay. So yeah, that's reporting.

Ahmed Jemaa

    So by weekly calls, of course, we also have weekly written updates and the click up. But yeah, on average, our clients take one to two hours.

    Yeah, including the calls one to two hours per week, including the calls. That's pretty much it.

Jennifer Roberge

    Okay. All right. Cool.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Yeah, I gotta go. Yeah, me too. But I think, yeah, is this clear? Yeah.

Jennifer Roberge

    I'll read the website and all that and get the pricing and everything there.

Ahmed Jemaa

    I'll also shoot you the recording of the session so that if you want to refer back to certain parts of it, you can watch it.

    And yeah, because we are, like I said, we're super, we're interested in getting the cleanup and then some sort of monthly thing to like follow and make sure everything's okay and test new things or whatever.

Jennifer Roberge

    So, yeah.

Ahmed Jemaa

    Cool. Okay.

Jennifer Roberge

    Nice to meet you. Bye. Recording. Thank you very much.
