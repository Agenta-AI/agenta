/**
 * The sentence behind a gateway refusal, rather than the transport's status line.
 *
 * Every gateway refusal carries `{code, message, retryable, next_step, details}` in the
 * response body, and a few older paths carry a plain string in `detail`. Axios throws
 * before any of that is read, and its own `message` is "Request failed with status code
 * 424", so a user who hits a refusal sees a number where a reason exists. Discovery
 * against a server that publishes no metadata is the common one: the body says "no
 * protected-resource metadata found" and the dialog used to show the 424.
 *
 * Nothing here invents copy. It returns what the server wrote, or `null` so the caller
 * keeps whatever wording it already had.
