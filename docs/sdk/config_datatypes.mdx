## Data types for parameters

There are multiple data types that can be used for the parameters in the configuration. Each data type translates into an element in the playground.

### TextParam

This display a text area widget in the playground. 

```python
agenta.config.default(prompt_system = ag.TextParam("You are an expert in geography."),
                      prompt_user = ag.TextParam("What is the capital of {country}?"))
``` 

### IntParam

This displays a slider widget in the playground with a step 1 (integers). 

```python
agenta.config.default(intval1 = ag.IntParam(default=1, minval=0, maxval=2),
                      intval2 = ag.IntParam(1)
```

### FloatParam

This displays a slider widget in the playground with a step 0.1 (float).


```python
agenta.config.default(temperature = ag.IntParam(default=0.5, minval=0, maxval=2),
                      temperature2 = ag.IntParam(0.5)
```


## Data types for inputs

Inputs in contrast to parameters are given as argument to the function decorated with `@agenta.entrypoint`. They are not part of the configuration but instead are the input in the call to the LLM app.

```python
def my_entrypoint(name:str):
```

Since the agenta sdk uses fastapi under the hood, the data types for the inputs are the same as the ones used in fastapi. In addition, there are some special data types.
