The `update` command serves to update the configuration of an Application Variant from the configuration defined in `<codebase_filename>.<configuration_name>.toml` to the Backend.
It is used to update the Backend with the changes you have made to an Application Variant.

```bash
agenta config update
```

> Batch updates the configuration for configurations defined in the format `<codebase_filename>.<configuration_name>.toml` for the Variants of an Application

or

```bash
agenta config pull <variant_name>
```

> Updates the configuration for variant whose configuration is defined in the format `<codebase_filename>.<configuration_name>.toml`

<Warning> The `config update` command can only be run in a directory where the `config.toml` generated by `agenta init` is present.</Warning>
