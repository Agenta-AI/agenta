```bash
agenta variant serve app_name.py
```

# Description
The `serve` command deploys the code of an app to the agenta platform. The command packages the code in the .py file along with any additional files in the same directory and deploy them on the agenta platform. Once deployed, the variant becomes accessible the web UI. It can ehtn be further deployed to a staging or production environment as an API endpoint.

In the agenta UI, the deployed variant is initially named `app_name.default` where `app_name` is the name of the python file deployed and `default` the default configuration. Creating a new configuration `someconfig` (either from the UI or from CLI), will result in the creation of corresponding new variant, named `app_name.someconfig`.


<Warning> The code in `app_name.py` needs to include an entrypoint function. This function should be marked with the `@agenta.entrypoint` decorator. </Warning>

Below is a brief example of a valid `app_name.py` file:

```python

import agenta as ag

ag.config.register_default(prompt="Translate {sentence} to {language})

@ag.entrypoint
def translate(sentence:str, language:str):
    ### add here openai call logic
```

<Warning> The `variant serve` command can only be run in a directory where the `config.toml` generated by `agenta init` is present.</Warning>
