```bash
agenta init
```

# Description


The init command initializes a new agenta project. Users can define the application's name and select the agenta platform host (either local or cloud).

This command creates a blank project in the backend and generates a config.toml file for configuration settings.

<Info>This command creates a `project.toml` file containing all the information about your project</Info>

# Usage

When running `agenta init` you will prompted the following questions:

### Project name
```bash
? Please enter the app name
```

Enter the app/project name

### Agenta host
```bash
? Where are you running agenta? (Use arrow keys)
 » On agenta cloud
   On my local machine
   On a remote machine
```

Here you can select where the agenta platform is hosted.
- Select cloud, in case you are using agenta cloud ([https://cloud.agenta.ai](https://cloud.agenta.ai)). In that case you will prompted to enter your API key. You can get these from the [agenta cloud configuration](https://cloud.agenta.ai/settings?tab=apiKeys).
- Select local machine if you are running the OSS version of agenta on your local machine ([http://localhost](http://localhost))
- Select remote machine, in case you are running the OSS version of agenta on a remote machine. In that case you will prompted to enter the remote machine URL.

<Note>You can skip the questions and initialize a new app in one line: `agenta init --app_name test --backend_host https://cloud.agenta.ai/`</Note>

<Info> In case you are running agenta enterprise, please refer to the enterprise documentation on how to set up your agenta project</Info>


### Start from scratch or from a template
```bash
? How do you want to initialize your app? (Use arrow keys)
 » Blank App
   Start from template
```

Chose blank app to start from scratch (write your own code) or start from template to use one of the agenta templates.
