### To add a new variant:

There are two ways to add a new variant to your app.
- By using a configuration file
- By creating it from an existing variant

#### Creating a variant from an existing variant
To create a new variant from an existing variant, you can run the following command:

```bash
agenta variant add --from <variant_name>
```
> Where `<variant_name>` is the name of the variant you want to base the new variant on.

or simply
    
```bash
agenta variant add
```
This command will list all the variants in the app and ask you to choose which one to use as a base for the new variant.

<Info> When you create a new variant from an existing variant, it inherits the parameters of that variant.</Info>

#### Using a configuration file

```bash
agenta variant add --config_file <codebase_filename>.<config_name>.toml
```

To add a new variant based on a configuration file you **must first** create a valid toml configuration file with the name format `<codebase_filename>.<config_name>.toml` in the directory where you executed the `agenta init` command.

> Where `<config_name>` is the name of the variant you want to create, and
> `<codebase_filename>` is the name of the deployed codebase file ( which is in the directory where the `config.toml` generated by `agenta init` is present. )

To create a valid toml configuration file, you can use the following template:

```toml
[parameters]
# Add your parameters here
```

For example, if you want to create a variant called `gpt3` with defined parameters for the `prompt` and `temperature`, supposing the name of your deployed codebase file is `app.py` you would create a toml file called `app.gpt3.toml` with the following content:

```toml
[parameters]
prompt = "Repeat my {name} is {name}"
temperature = 0.9
```
Thereafter, you would run the following command to create the variant `agenta variant add --config_file app.gpt3.toml`
