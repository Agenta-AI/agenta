# In-depth on CLI

## Commands

### `agenta variant serve`

When you execute `agenta variant serve`, it performs the following tasks:

Copies your code into a temporary folder and supplements it with our proprietary code (dockerfile, agenta.py, etc.)
Constructs a Docker image from the content in the temporary folder
Uploads the Docker image to the registry
Notifies the API about the new Docker image
Instructs the backend to launch the Docker image

# In-depth on backend

## Creating a New App
Users can create a new app in two ways: via the CLI or the web app.

### CLI
Upon executing `agenta init`, we solicit the app name and store it in `config.toml`. At this stage, the app exists only locally within the user's directory. It gets incorporated into the backend only after the user executes the `agenta variant serve` command.

When a user runs `agenta variant serve` for the first time within an app, we instantiate the new app in the backend. For each newly served variant, we add a new variant to the app name specified in `config.toml`.



### Web app
Users can also create a new app via the web app. However, new apps in this context can only be created based on a template. This implies that the user won't have access to the app code but can only use the container. If the user requires access to the app code, they must initiate the process from the CLI.

When a user starts a new app from the web app, they need to select a template. In this case, we instruct the backend to initiate an app from a template. The template is a Docker image located in some registry which the backend downloads, adds to the registry, initializes a new app, and subsequently launches it.


## Creating a new variant

### CLI
The procedure is exactly the same as when creating a new app, even down to the API calls. The only difference is that the backend adds a new variant to an existing app rather than creating a new app (according to the database schema).


### Web app
Users can also create a new app variant by forking an existing one via the web UI.
When a user formulates a new variant in the playground, it only virtually exists, with its parameters stored in the UI. The variant truly comes into existence only when the user saves the new variant. At this stage, the backend replicates the new variant and mounts a new volume to the image with the new default parameters.
In this scenario, the SDK bypasses the code's default parameters and instead uses those within the mounted volume.

# Database Schema

Our current schema is rudementary:

```python
class ImageDB(SQLModel, table=True):
    """Defines the info needed to get an image and connect it to the app variant
    """
    id: int = Field(default=None, primary_key=True)
    docker_id: str = Field(...)
    tags: str = Field(...)


class AppVariantDB(SQLModel, table=True):
    """Defines an app variant and connects to an image    """
    id: Optional[int] = Field(default=None, primary_key=True)
    app_name: str = Field(...)
    variant_name: str = Field(...)
    image_id: int = Field(foreign_key="imagedb.id")


class App(SQLModel, table=True):
    """Defines an app """
    id: int = Field(default=None, primary_key=True)
    app_name: str = Field(...)
```

The first time the user adds an app variant, we update the App table then the AppVariant table. Subsequently, we only update the AppVariant table.


# Future Considerations:
An alternative approach to implementing this is by modifying the image code to incorporate new elements as files. However, this would imply that the backend has access to the code.

Looking forward, if Agenta is linked to git, many processes could be simplified.

If the user initiates a variant from the web UI, we could facilitate them to fork a GitHub repository into their own account. Subsequently, we could create a new app in the backend (transferring the CLI's logic to the backend), allowing us to access the code. We could then generate new backend variants by modifying the code in the repository. The main concern here is speed. Creating new variants would involve pulling the code, altering it, creating a new branch, pushing, building the image, and starting it, which is time-consuming. However, this process could potentially be done in the background. The primary consideration remains the importance of versioning.
