Sometimes, custom evaluators on Agenta may not be sufficient for your specific use case, or you may wish to host your own evaluators. In such cases, you can create a webhook evaluator to suit your specific needs. Webhook evaluators only need to comply with a predefined API.

<Info>For the moment, there are limitation on the security measures related to webhook evaluators. There is no authentication and no authorization, and the endpoint must be publicly available. </Info>


## Accessing the Evaluator Page
To create a webhook evaluator on Agenta, simply click on the Evaluations button in the sidebar menu, and then select the "Evaluators" tab within the Evaluations page.

## Creating an Evaluator
On the Evaluators tab, click on the "New Evaluator" button at the top right corner of your screen which would open a modal prompting you to provide the following information:
1. <b>Name: </b> Enter a unique and descriptive name for your webhook evaluator.
2. <b>Webhook URL: </b> Enter the public URL for your webhook evaluator.

Click on the "Create" button within the modal to confirm and complete the creation of your webhook evaluator.

## Webhook API

The input parameters are as follows:
1. <b>inputs: </b> A dictionary containing the inputs to the webhook evaluators. 
2. <b>output: </b> The output generated by the LLM app.
3. <b>correct_answer: </b> The expected correct answer for the LLM app. 

The webhook request body has the following signature:
```json
{
    "inputs": { "{input_1}": <String> [,"{input_2}": <String>, ...] }
    "output": <String>,
    "correct_answer": <String>
}
```

The output parameters are as follows:
1. <b>score: </b> A float value corresponding to the score of the evaluation. The score should be between 0 and 1, with 0 meaning the evaluation failed, with its lowest score, and 1 meaning the evaluation succeeded, with its highest score.

The webhook response body has the following signature:
```json
{
    "score": <Float>
}
```

The webhook response `status` must be `200` for successful evaluations, the webhook response `Content-Type` header should be set to `application/json`, and the webhook response body must be a properly-formatted JSON object.
