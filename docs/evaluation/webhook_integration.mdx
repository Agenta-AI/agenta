**Webhook Evaluators** are used to connect your application with an external service for evaluating the outputs of your model.
Instead of running evaluations directly within the platform, the Webhook Evaluator sends the model's outputs, along with any necessary input data, to an external URL that you specify.

Agenta allows you to host your own evaluators, allowing you to create a webhook evaluator to suit your specific needs.
The Webhook evaluators only need to comply with a predefined API.

## Webhook Evaluator

In Agenta, the **Webhook test evaluator** sends the generated answer and the `correct_answer` to a webhook and expects a response, in **JSON** format,
indicating the correctness of the answer, along with a `200` HTTP status.
You need to provide the URL of the webhook and the response of the webhook must be between 0 and 1.

To create a **webhook evaluator** on Agenta, simply click on the _Automatic Evaluation_ in the sidebar menu, and then select the **Evaluators** tab.
Click on the **New Evaluator** button and select **Webhook test**.

Configure the Webhook test evaluator by providing a unique `name` and `Webhook URL` which is a public URL for your webhook evaluator (_must be a valid URL e.g https://your-webhook-url.com_)

Click on the **Save** button within the modal to confirm the creation of your webhook evaluator.

### Webhook API

The input parameters are as follows:

1. `inputs`: A dictionary containing the inputs to the webhook evaluators.
2. `output`: The output generated by the LLM app.
3. `correct_answer`: The expected correct answer for the LLM app.

The webhook request body has the following signature:

```json
{
    "inputs": { "{input_1}": <String> [,"{input_2}": <String>, ...] }
    "output": <String>,
    "correct_answer": <String>
}
```

The output parameters are as follows:

1. `score`: A float value corresponding to the score of the evaluation. The
   score should be between 0 and 1, with 0 meaning the evaluation failed, with its
   lowest score, and 1 meaning the evaluation succeeded, with its highest score.

The webhook response body has the following signature:

```json
{
    "score": <Float>
}
```

The webhook response `status` must be `200` for successful evaluations, the webhook response `Content-Type` header should be set to `application/json`, and the webhook response body must be a properly-formatted JSON object.

  Attention: There are limitation on the security measures related to webhook
  evaluators. There is no authentication and no authorization, and the endpoint
  must be publicly available.{" "}
