## AWS
We provide a Terraform module to deploy Agenta on AWS. You can find it [here](https://github.com/Agenta-AI/agenta/tree/main/self-host/aws).
The terraform module will simply create a t2.medium instance, a security group (with the open ports: 80, 8080), an elastic IP and an ebs volume all of them in eu-central-1.
You can customize the module according to your needs.

First of all install [terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli) and [configure your AWS credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html).
then run these commands:
```bash
cd self-host/aws
terraform init
terraform apply
```

Terraform will ask if you want to deploy to a specific domain.
You can either specify a domain or leave it blank.

Once terraform is done from creating the resources it will print an the domain name or the ip where you can access Agenta from.
This is an example of the output:
```
Open the link below in your browser to access Agenta, you need to wait a few minutes for services to start.

Imortant: If you have provided a domain name, you can access Agenta using that domain name,
You need however to make sure that the domain name is pointing to this IP address: x.x.x.x

Link: http://demo.agenta.ai
```

As mentioned in the output, if you provided a domain name, you need to make sure that the domain name is pointing to the IP address provided by terraform.

It will not be directly accessible as it needs to install dependencies and to run Agenta. So we need to wait a couple of minutes.
More details are specified in this script: [instance-setup.sh](https://github.com/Agenta-AI/agenta/blob/main/self-host/aws/instance-setup.sh)

**NOTE: We do not have any security mechanism in place yet.**

#### SSH into the instance:
In order to ssh into the instance you need to:

1. Uncomment these lines in the [security group](https://github.com/Agenta-AI/agenta/blob/main/self-host/aws/agenta_instance_sg.tf)
```bash
ingress {
  description = "SSH"
  from_port   = 22
  to_port     = 22
  protocol    = "tcp"
  cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
}
```

and also these line in the [instance](https://github.com/Agenta-AI/agenta/blob/main/self-host/aws/agenta_instance.tf) file:

```bash
resource "aws_key_pair" "agenta_key" {
  key_name   = "agenta-key"
  public_key = file("~/.ssh/id_rsa_agenta.pub")
}


key_name      = aws_key_pair.agenta_key.key_name
```

2. create a key pair in the AWS console or via the command:
```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa_agenta
```

3. and then run this command:
```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa_agenta ubuntu@ec2-host-provided-by-aws
```

#### Rremove all the resources:

To remove all the resources created by terraform run:
```bash
cd self-host/aws
terraform destroy
```
