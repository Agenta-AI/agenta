## AWS
We provide a Terraform module to deploy Agenta on AWS. You can find it [here](https://github.com/Agenta-AI/agenta/tree/main/self-host/aws).
The terraform module will simply create a t2.medium instance, a security group (with the open ports: 80, 8080), an elastic IP and an ebs volume all of them in eu-central-1.
You can customize the module according to your needs.

First of all install [terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli) and [configure your AWS credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html).
then run these commands:
```bash
cd self-host/aws
terraform init
terraform apply
```

Terraform will ask if you want to deploy to a specific domain.
You can either specify a domain or leave it blank.

Once terraform is done from creating the resources it will print an ip where you can access Agenta on or the domain name you provided.
```
Outputs:

open_in_browser_this_ip = "http://x.x.x.x"
```

```
Outputs:

open_in_browser_this_ip = "http://domain.com"
```

It will not be directly accessible as it needs to install dependencies and to run Agenta. So we need to wait a couple of minutes.
More details are specified in this script: [instance-setup.sh](https://github.com/Agenta-AI/agenta/blob/main/self-host/aws/instance-setup.sh)

**NOTE: We do not have any security mechanism in place yet.**

#### SSH into the instance:
In order to ssh into the instance you need to:

1. Uncomment these lines in the [security group](https://github.com/Agenta-AI/agenta/blob/main/self-host/aws/agenta_instance_sg.tf)
```bash
ingress {
  description = "SSH"
  from_port   = 22
  to_port     = 22
  protocol    = "tcp"
  cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
}
```

and also these line in the [instance](https://github.com/Agenta-AI/agenta/blob/main/self-host/aws/agenta_instance.tf) file:

```bash
resource "aws_key_pair" "agenta_key" {
  key_name   = "agenta-key"
  public_key = file("~/.ssh/id_rsa_agenta.pub")
}


key_name      = aws_key_pair.agenta_key.key_name
```

2. create a key pair in the AWS console or via the command:
```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa_agenta
```

3. and then run this command:
```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa_agenta ubuntu@ec2-host-provided-by-aws
```

#### Rremove all the resources:

To remove all the resources created by terraform run:
```bash
cd self-host/aws
terraform destroy
```
