## Requirements

Agenta requires Docker installed on your machine. If you don't have Docker, you can install it from [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

## The components of Agenta

Agenta is a platform made of multiple components all in the same repository:

- The SDK: a Python package that allows you to interact with the Agenta platform which you use in your applications
- The CLI: a command line interface that allows you to serve LLM-applications to be tested in the web platform
- The web platform: a web application that allows you to test your LLM-applications in a web browser (made of a nextjs frontend and a python backend)

To install Agenta, you need first to install the python package containing both the SDK and the CLI. Then, you need to install the web platform.

## Installing the SDK and CLI

To install the SDK and CLI, you can use pip:

```bash
pip install agenta
```

Please see [contributing](/contributing/development-mode) for more information on how to install the SDK and CLI for developement.
