Below is a guide to upgrading Agenta to the latest version. Note that our project is in active development, and while we make every effort to support migrations, they may not always be possible due to substantial changes. It's crucial to backup your data before attempting to upgrade. If you have any questions or need help, please don't hesitate to contact us.

To upgrade Agenta to the latest version, please follow the steps below:

## 1. Backup your data

Before starting the upgrade process, ensure you have a full backup of your existing data. This is a crucial step as it allows you to restore your data to its original state in case something goes wrong during the upgrade.

## 2. Pull the latest version of the code

```bash
git pull origin main
```

This command fetches the latest version of the Agenta code from the main branch.

## 3. Identify and run any database migrations

Navigate to the `agenta-backend/db/migration/mongodb/` directory. Here, you'll find folders for each version migration. Identify the migration scripts you need to run based on the current version of your application and the version you're upgrading to (e.g., v0.19 to v0.20).

First, ensure you have pymongo installed:

```bash
pip install pymongo
```

Then, run the migration script:

```bash
python run_migrations.py
```

Please note that the above command is an example. You need to replace `run_migrations.py` with the specific migration script relevant to your upgrade path.

## 4. Verify the upgrade

After the migration has completed, verify the upgrade by starting the application and checking its version. Conduct any necessary testing to ensure the application is running as expected.

Remember, we're here to help. If you encounter any issues during the upgrade, please contact us.
