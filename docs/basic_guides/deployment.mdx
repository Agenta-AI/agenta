After using the playground to find a good configuration for your application, it's time to deploy the application.
By deploying the application, you can integrate it with short code snippet in your applicatoin. You can later change the configuration from the UI without having to update the code.


Agenta provides a way to deploy an application to multiple environments: development, staging, and production. Each environment has its own unique configuration.

## Deploying an application to an environment:

1. Navigate to the playground for the variant you want to deploy.
2. Click on 'Publish'. Make sure the variant is saved before deployment.

3. Select the environment and click on "Publish"

The application is now deployed to the chosen environment and is accessible as an API endpoint.

## Accessing the API endpoint:

1. Go to the 'API endpoint' section.
2. Choose the environment where the application was deployed.

3. Here, you'll find the application code in various languages, which can be embedded in your application code.

Additionally, you can use the configuration in your application code without using Agenta deployment. This can be achieved by using the Python SDK or the REST API. More information can be found on the page 'Integrating Agenta with Your Application'.`
