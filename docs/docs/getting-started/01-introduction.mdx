Agenta is an **open-source LLMOps platform** that helps **developers** and **product teams** build reliable LLM applications.


Agenta covers the entire LLM development lifecycle: **prompt management**, **evaluation**, and **observability**.

## Features

### Prompt Engineering and Management

Agenta enables product teams to experiment with prompts, push them to production, run  evaluations, and annotate their results.



### Evaluation

Agenta enables product teams to experiment with prompts, push them to production, run  evaluations, and annotate their results.



### Observability

Agenta enables product teams to experiment with prompts, push them to production, run  evaluations, and annotate their results.



## Why Agenta?

### Enable collaboration between developers and product teams

Agenta empowers **non-developers** to iterate on the configuration of any custom LLM application, evaluate it, annotate it, A/B test it, and deploy it, all within the user interface.

### Open-source and MIT licensed

Agenta is open-source and MIT licensed, so you can self-host it, modify it, and use it in commercial projects without restrictions.

### Works with any LLM app workflow

Agenta enables prompt engineering and evaluation on any LLM app architecture, such as **Chain of Prompts**, **RAG**, or **LLM agents**. It is compatible with any framework like **Langchain** or **LlamaIndex**, and works with any model provider, such as **OpenAI**, **Cohere**, or **local models**.
