This guide covers tracking chat sessions with the Agenta Python SDK. For JavaScript/TypeScript or other OpenTelemetry-based clients, see the [session tracking with OpenTelemetry guide](/observability/trace-with-opentelemetry/session-tracking).

Chat applications often span multiple requests and traces. Session tracking groups related interactions together so you can analyze complete conversations and user journeys.

## What are sessions?

A session represents a conversation or interaction that spans multiple traces. When you assign a session ID to your traces, all observations with the same ID are grouped together. This helps you:

- Analyze complete conversation flows
- Debug issues in multi-turn interactions
- Track costs and token usage per conversation
- Filter and search traces by session

## Setting session IDs

Use `ag.tracing.store_session()` to set session information on your spans.

```python
import agenta as ag

@ag.instrument()
def process_message(message: str, session_id: str):
    # Set session ID
    ag.tracing.store_session(
        session_id=session_id,
    )

    # Your processing logic
    response = generate_response(message)
    return response
```

You can also set user information to track who is interacting:

```python
@ag.instrument()
def process_message(message: str, session_id: str, user_id: str):
    # Set session information
    ag.tracing.store_session(session_id=session_id)

    # Set user information
    ag.tracing.store_user(
        user_id=user_id,
    )

    response = generate_response(message)
    return response
```
