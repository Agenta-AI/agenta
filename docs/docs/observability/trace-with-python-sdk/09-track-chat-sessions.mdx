Chat applications often span multiple requests and traces. Session tracking groups related interactions together so you can analyze complete conversations and user journeys.

## What are sessions?

A session represents a conversation or interaction that spans multiple traces. When you assign a session ID to your traces, all observations with the same ID are grouped together. This helps you:

- Analyze complete conversation flows
- Debug issues in multi-turn interactions
- Track costs and token usage per conversation
- Filter and search traces by session

## Setting session IDs

Use `ag.tracing.store_meta()` to set a session ID on your spans. 

```python
import agenta as ag

@ag.instrument()
def process_message(message: str, session_id: str):
    ag.tracing.store_meta({"session_id": session_id})
    
    # Your processing logic
    response = generate_response(message)
    return response
```
