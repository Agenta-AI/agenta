<!-- TODO: Add content for sampling strategies -->

## Overview

Sampling allows you to control which traces are sent to Agenta, helping reduce costs and storage when dealing with high-volume applications.

## Why sample?

- Reduce storage costs
- Minimize performance impact
- Focus on interesting traces (errors, slow requests)

## Next steps

- Learn about [batching traces](/observability/trace-with-python-sdk/batch-traces)
- Explore [cost tracking](/observability/trace-with-python-sdk/track-costs)
