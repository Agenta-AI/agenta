`agenta.config.pull(config_name: str = "default", environment_name: str = None)`

This function pulls the configuration from the backend and save them in the config object. The configuration contains all the parameters for the variant. 

The configuration can be pulled by name. For instance
```python
agenta.config.pull("my_config")
```

This would pull the parameters from the backend for the configuration `my_config` (that is for `variant_name.py`, the configuration in the playground for the variant `variant_name.my_config`)

The configuration can also be pulled by the environment name. For instance, you can always use the parameters from the 'production' environment by using:

```python
agenta.config.pull(environment_name = "production")
```

After pulling the configuration, the parameters are accessible in the following way:

```python
agenta.config.parameter_name
```
