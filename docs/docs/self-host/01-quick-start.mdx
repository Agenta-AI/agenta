This guide explains how to set up Agenta on your local machine, either using the default port 80 or a custom port.

## Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your machine ([Download Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/))

## Quick Setup (Port 80)

1. Clone Agenta:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Agenta-AI/agenta && cd agenta
```

2. Copy `hosting/docker-compose/oss/.env.oss.gh.example` to `hosting/docker-compose/oss/.env.oss.gh` and edit the configuration.

3. Start Agenta services:
```bash
docker compose -f hosting/docker-compose/oss/docker-compose.gh.yml --env-file hosting/docker-compose/oss/.env.oss.gh --profile with-web --profile with-traefik up -d
```

4. Access Agenta at `http://localhost`.

## Using a Custom Port

To use a different port (e.g., 90):

Change the following variables in the environment file `/hosting/docker-compose/oss/.env.oss.gh` then restart the services:
```bash
TRAEFIK_PORT=90
AGENTA_SERVICES_URL=http://localhost:90/services
AGENTA_API_URL=http://localhost:90/api
AGENTA_WEB_URL=http://localhost:90
```

## Upgrading to the Latest Version of Agenta

Updating your local Agenta installation to the latest version, requires pulling the latest version with `--pull always` and running migrations if any.

1. Pull the latest version:
```bash
docker compose -f hosting/docker-compose/oss/docker-compose.gh.yml --env-file hosting/docker-compose/oss/.env.oss.gh  --profile with-web --profile with-traefik up -d --pull always
```

2. Run migrations if needed:
```bash
docker exec -e PYTHONPATH=/app -w /app/oss/databases/postgres/migrations/core agenta-oss-gh-api-1 alembic -c alembic.ini upgrade head
```

Consult the [upgrading guide](/self-host/upgrading) for more details.

## Troubleshooting

If Agenta doesn't start properly, check these common issues:

1. Port conflicts: Verify if another application is using your chosen port.
2. Container status: Run `docker ps` to check if all Agenta containers are running
3. Logs: Examine container logs with:
   ```bash
   docker logs agenta-oss-gh-web
   docker logs agenta-oss-gh-api
   ```
4. SDK connectivity issues: If you're using the Agenta SDK from outside Docker to connect to your localhost Agenta instance and experiencing connection failures, ensure the `DOCKER_NETWORK_MODE` environment variable is unset (this is the default behavior).
5. Lack of memory provided to docker: If you are experiencing the web container restarting and dying unexpectedly, the most likely cause is that you are running out of memory. You may need to increase the memory allocated to docker (desktop).
