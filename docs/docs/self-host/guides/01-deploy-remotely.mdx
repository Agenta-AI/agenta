This guide shows you how to deploy Agenta on a remote server, whether that's a cloud instance (like AWS EC2, Google Cloud, or DigitalOcean) or your own dedicated machine. By the end, you'll have Agenta running and accessible from anywhere on the internet.

## What You'll Need

Before starting, make sure your remote server has:

**Server Requirements:**
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Root access or sudo privileges
- Git installed

**Network Requirements:**
- Open ports for web traffic (typically port 80 for HTTP)
- A domain name pointed to your server (optional but recommended)

## Understanding the Deployment Options

Agenta offers two reverse proxy options for remote deployment:

- **Traefik (Default)**: Modern reverse proxy with automatic service discovery and built-in SSL certificate management
- **Nginx**: Traditional web server and reverse proxy, useful if you already use Nginx in your infrastructure

Choose Traefik unless you have specific requirements for Nginx.

## Step 1: Get the Agenta Code

Clone the Agenta repository to your server:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/agenta-ai/agenta
cd agenta
```

## Step 2: Configure Your Deployment

### Understanding Environment Variables

Agenta uses environment variables to configure how it runs on your server. The main settings control:

- **Domain/IP**: Where users will access Agenta
- **Ports**: Which network ports to use
- **URLs**: How different services communicate with each other

### Edit the Configuration File

Open the environment configuration file:

```bash
nano hosting/docker-compose/oss/.env.oss.gh
```

Update these key variables based on your setup:

**For Domain-Based Setup:**
```bash
# Replace with your actual domain
TRAEFIK_PORT=80                           # Port for web access
TRAEFIK_DOMAIN=yourdomain.com             # Your domain without http://
AGENTA_API_URL=http://yourdomain.com/api      # Full URL with protocol
AGENTA_WEB_URL=http://yourdomain.com      # Same as API URL in most cases
AGENTA_SERVICES_URL=http://yourdomain.com:80/services  # URL for internal services
```

**For IP Address Setup:**
If you don't have a domain name, you can use your server's IP address:

```bash
TRAEFIK_PORT=80
TRAEFIK_DOMAIN=192.168.1.100              # Replace with your server's IP
AGENTA_API_URL=http://192.168.1.100/api
AGENTA_WEB_URL=http://192.168.1.100
AGENTA_SERVICES_URL=http://192.168.1.100:80/services
```

### Additional Configuration Options

For more advanced settings like SSL, authentication, or custom ports, see our [complete configuration guide](/self-host/configuration).

## Step 3: Deploy Agenta

### Option 1: Deploy with Traefik (Recommended)

```bash
docker compose -f hosting/docker-compose/oss/docker-compose.gh.yml --env-file=hosting/docker-compose/oss/.env.oss.gh --profile with-web up -d
```

**What this command does:**
- `-f hosting/docker-compose/oss/docker-compose.gh.yml`: Uses the production Docker Compose configuration
- `--env-file=hosting/docker-compose/oss/.env.oss.gh`: Loads your environment variables
- `--profile with-web`: Includes the web interface in the deployment
- `up -d`: Starts all services in the background

### Option 2: Deploy with Nginx

If you prefer Nginx or need to integrate with existing Nginx configurations:

```bash
docker compose -f hosting/docker-compose/oss/docker-compose.gh.yml --env-file=hosting/docker-compose/oss/.env.oss.gh --profile with-web --profile nginx up -d
```

## Step 4: Verify Your Deployment

### Check Service Status

Monitor the startup process by checking container status:

```bash
# View all containers and their status
docker compose ps

# Watch the startup logs (useful for troubleshooting)
docker compose logs -f
```

You should see all services show "Up" status. The initial startup may take a few minutes as Docker downloads images and initializes services.

### Test Web Access

Once all services are running, test access through your web browser:

**With domain name:**
```
http://yourdomain.com
```

**With IP address:**
```
http://192.168.1.100
```

You should see the Agenta login page. If you can access it, your deployment is successful!

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Services Won't Start

**Check container logs:**
```bash
docker compose logs
```

**Common solutions:**
- Ensure environment variables are set correctly
- Check that ports aren't already in use


**Common solutions:**
- Verify firewall settings allow traffic on port 80
- Check that your domain DNS is pointing to the server
- Ensure AGENTA_WEB_URL matches how you're accessing the site


### Nginx-Specific Issues

If you chose the Nginx deployment option:

**Test Nginx configuration:**
```bash
# Check Nginx configuration syntax
docker compose exec nginx nginx -t

# View Nginx logs
docker compose logs nginx
```
