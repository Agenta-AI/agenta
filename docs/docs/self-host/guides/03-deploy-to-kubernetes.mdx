For the moment Kubernetes deployment is only available part of our Enterprise Edition (EE). Agenta Enterprise is the best way to self-host Agenta. It is highly scalable and the data never leaves your environment. It provides the tools to manage multiple users and teams all in one place.

Agenta Enterprise is an early access stage for select partners. [Reach out](https://cal.com/mahmoud-mabrouk-ogzgey/demo) to inquire for more details.
