This guide covers how Agenta SDK automatically handles host configuration based on your deployment environment, ensuring proper connectivity for your applications.

## Overview

The Agenta SDK automatically handles host configuration based on your deployment environment to ensure proper connectivity.

## How it works

The SDK uses the `DOCKER_NETWORK_MODE` setting to determine how to handle host URLs:

- **Inside Docker containers** (network mode: bridge): The SDK automatically converts `localhost` references to `host.docker.internal` to enable communication between containers
- **Outside Docker** (network mode: host/default): The SDK preserves your original host configuration (e.g., `localhost` remains `localhost`). Note: "default" means `DOCKER_NETWORK_MODE` is not set when using the SDK outside Docker

## Common scenarios

| Environment | Network Mode | Host Setting | Result |
|------------|--------------|--------------|--------|
| AI services running in Docker | bridge | `localhost` | `host.docker.internal` |
| Local development outside Docker | host/default* | `localhost` | `localhost` |
| Custom host URL | any | `https://my-api.com` | `https://my-api.com` |

*default = `DOCKER_NETWORK_MODE` environment variable is not set

## Troubleshooting

If you're experiencing connectivity issues, verify that:
- Your host configuration matches your deployment environment
- The `DOCKER_NETWORK_MODE` is correctly set for your environment (bridge for Docker, host/default for outside Docker)
- When running outside Docker, use `localhost` or your actual API URL
- When running inside Docker, the SDK will handle host resolution automatically
