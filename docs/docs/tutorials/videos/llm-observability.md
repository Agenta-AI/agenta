## Why You Need LLM Observability

LLM applications are probabilistic and non-deterministic. This makes them unreliable. This video explains why observability is critical for building reliable AI applications.

What you'll learn:

- **Debug AI agents** by viewing complete traces with inputs and outputs for each step
- **Build a data flywheel** to improve your application iteratively using production data
- **Manage costs** by understanding which steps and users consume the most resources

## OpenTelemetry for LLM Observability

This video covers the technical implementation of LLM observability using OpenTelemetry.

    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
    allowFullScreen
  ></iframe>
</div>

What you'll learn:

- **How traces work** and why they matter for LLM applications
- **OpenTelemetry standard** that lets you swap observability platforms without code changes
- **Auto-instrumentation libraries** that add observability with one line of code
- **Higher-level SDKs** from platforms like Agenta that simplify implementation
