## Overview

The playground offers a convenient way to create and add data to a test set. This workflow is useful when you discover interesting cases or edge cases while experimenting with your LLM application.

## Adding data points from the playground

To add a data point to a test set from the playground:

1. Work with your application in the playground
2. When you find an interesting case, click the `Add to test set` button located near the `Run` button
3. A drawer will display showing the inputs and outputs from the playground
4. You can modify inputs and correct answers if needed
5. Select an existing test set to add to, or choose `+Add new` to create a new one
6. Once you're satisfied, click `Add` to finalize
