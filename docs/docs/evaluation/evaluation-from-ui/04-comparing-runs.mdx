## Overview

Compare evaluations to understand which variant performs better. This helps you make data-driven decisions about your LLM application.

## Prerequisites

To compare evaluations, you need:

- Two or more completed evaluations
- All evaluations must use the same test set

## Starting a comparison

After your evaluations complete, you can compare two or more of them:

1. Go to the Evaluations page
2. Click the compare button in the top right corner of the evaluation results page
3. Select the evaluations you want to compare 


## Overview comparison tab

The overview comparison tab shows aggregated results for all evaluators. The figures let you compare results between evaluations.

## Prompt configuration comparison tab

The prompt configuration comparison tab shows the prompt configuration used for each evaluation. The figures let you compare prompt configurations between evaluations.
