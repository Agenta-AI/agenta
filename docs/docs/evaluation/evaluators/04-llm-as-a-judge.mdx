LLM-as-a-Judge is an evaluator that uses an LLM to assess LLM outputs. It's particularly useful for evaluating text generation tasks or chatbots where there's no single correct answer.

![Configuration of LLM-as-a-judge](/images/evaluation/llm-as-a-judge.png)

The evaluator has the following parameters:

#### The Prompt

You can configure the prompt used for evaluation. The prompt can contain multiple messages in OpenAI format (role/content). All messages in the prompt have access to the inputs, outputs, and reference answers (any columns in the test set). To reference these in your prompts, use the following variables:

- `correct_answer`: the column with the reference answer in the test set. You can configure the name of this column under `Advanced Setting` in the configuration modal.
- `prediction`: the output of the llm application
- `$input_column_name`: the value of any input column for the given row of your test set

Here's the default prompt used for the country expert demo application (note that it uses the `country` input column from our test set):

**System prompt:**

```
You are an evaluator grading an LLM App.
 You will be given INPUTS, the LLM APP OUTPUT, the CORRECT ANSWER, the PROMPT used in the LLM APP.
 Here is the grade criteria to follow:
:- Ensure that the LLM APP OUTPUT has the same meaning as the CORRECT ANSWER

SCORE:
-The score should be between 0 and 10
-A score of 10 means that the answer is perfect. This is the highest (best) score.
A score of 0 means that the answer does not any of of the criteria. This is the lowest possible score you can give.

ANSWER ONLY THE SCORE. DO NOT USE MARKDOWN. DO NOT PROVIDE ANYTHING OTHER THAN THE NUMBER
```

**User prompt:**

```

INPUTS:
country: {country}
CORRECT ANSWER:{correct_answer}
LLM APP OUTPUT: {prediction}.

```

### The Model

The model can be configured to select one of the supported options (`gpt-3.5-turbo`, `gpt-4`, `claude-3-5-sonnet`, `claude-3-5-haiku`, `claude-3-5-opus`). To use LLM-as-a-Judge, you'll need to set your OpenAI or Anthropic API key in the settings. The key is saved locally and only sent to our servers for evaluationâ€”it's not stored there.
