This guide will show you how to run evaluations from the UI.

Before you get started, make sure that you have [created a test set](/evaluation/create-test-sets) and [configured evaluators](/evaluation/configure-evaluators) appropriate for your task.

## Running Evaluations

To start an evaluation, navigate to the Evaluations page and click the `Start new evaluation` button. A modal will appear, allowing you to setup the evaluation.

### Setting Up Evaluation Parameters

In the modal, specify the following:

- <b>Testset:</b> Choose the testset(s) for your evaluation.
- <b>Variants:</b> Choose one or more variants to evaluate.
- <b>Evaluators:</b> Pick one or more evaluators for assessment.

#### Advanced Configuration

Additional settings allow you to adjust batching and retry parameters for LLM calls. This help mitigating rate limit errors from your LLM provider.

Advanced configuration options include:

- **Batch Size:** Number of test cases to run concurrently in each batch (default: 10).
- **Retry Delay:** Time to wait before retrying a failed call (default: 3s).
- **Max Retries:** Maximum number of retry attempts for a failed call (default: 3).
- **Delay Between Batches:** Pause duration between batch runs (default: 5s).

## Analyzing Evaluation Results

The main view offers an aggregated summary of results. Each column displays the average score per evaluator for each variant/test set combination. You'll also see average latency, total cost, creation date, and evaluation status.

For a detailed view of an evaluation, click on a completed evaluation row.

The evaluation table columns show inputs, reference answers used by evaluators, LLM application output, evaluator results, cost, and latency.

## Comparing Evaluations

Once evaluations are marked "completed," you can compare two or more evaluations <b>from the same test set</b>. Click the `Compare` button to access the Evaluation comparison view, where you can analyze outputs from multiple evaluations side by side.
