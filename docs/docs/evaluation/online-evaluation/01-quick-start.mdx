Online Evaluation allows you to continuously evaluate your LLM application on production traces. Instead of running evaluations on static test sets, you can automatically sample and evaluate real traffic.

## Setting Up Online Evaluation

Navigate to the **Evaluations** page and select the **Online Evaluation** tab.

Click **Create Online Evaluation** to set up a new evaluation:

1. **Name**: Provide a descriptive name for your online evaluation.
2. **Evaluator**: Select one or more evaluators to run on sampled traces.
3. **Trace Filter**: Define which traces to evaluate (e.g., filter by application, variant, or metadata).
4. **Sampling Rate**: Set the percentage of matching traces to evaluate (e.g., 10% to sample 1 in 10 traces).

Click **Create** to start the online evaluation. Results will appear as traces are processed.

## Viewing Results

Online evaluation results are displayed in real-time as traces are sampled and evaluated. You can:

- View aggregated metrics over time
- Drill down into individual evaluated traces
- Compare performance across different time periods

## Use Cases

- **Production Monitoring**: Continuously monitor model quality on real user inputs
- **Regression Detection**: Catch performance degradation early
- **A/B Testing**: Compare different model versions on live traffic
