title: "Regex Evaluator"
---

Regular Expressions (Regex) are sequences of characters that define search patterns, often used for pattern matching
within strings. The `Regex Test` evaluator checks if the generated answer matches a regular expression pattern.

The evaluator takes the regex pattern, and whether to match or not match for that pattern.

Here are some examples:

| Output                                 | Regex         | Match/Mismatch | Evaluator Output |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------- | -------------- | ---------------- |
| The iPhone 6 has a 1024px screen       | `.*iphone.*`  | `match`        | True             |
| The Samsung galaxy has a 1024px screen | `.*Samsung.*` | `mismatch`     | False            |
