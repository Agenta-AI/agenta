## Prerequisites

Before starting, familiarize yourself with how versioning works in Agenta. Details are available on the [concepts page](/concepts/concepts).

Agenta uses a Git-like structure for prompt versioning:
- Create multiple branches called **variants**
- Each variant is versioned.
- Deploy specific versions to **environments** (development, staging, production)

**Typical workflow:**
1. Create a variant (branch)
2. Commit changes to the variant creating a new version
3. Deploy the version to an environment

## Setup the SDK

Initialize the SDK before using any operations:

```python
import os
import agenta as ag

# Set your API credentials
os.environ["AGENTA_API_KEY"] = "your-api-key-here"
os.environ["AGENTA_HOST"] = "https://cloud.agenta.ai" # only needed if self-hosting

# Initialize the SDK
ag.init()
```

:::info
You can skip this step if you are using the API directly.
