# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Agenta uses role-based access control (RBAC) to manage what members can do inside an **organization** and its **projects**.

:::info[Plan availability]
RBAC is available on **Business** and **Enterprise** plans. You can upgrade from your billing settings or see options at https://agenta.ai/pricing.

## Roles

Agenta provides these built-in roles:

| Role | What it is for |
|------|-----------------|
| **Owner** | Full control of the organization, including member management |
| **Admin** | Administer members and organization settings |
| **Editor** | Create and edit most resources in projects |
| **Viewer** | Read-only access |
| **Evaluator** | Run evaluations and review results |
| **Deployment Manager** | Manage deployments |

## Permissions

Under the hood, Agenta authorizes requests using granular permissions. These permissions cover actions across the product, such as:

- Applications and variants
- Workflows
- Evaluations and test sets
- Observability (traces/spans, annotations)
- Secrets and API keys
- Deployments and environments
- Organization membership and roles
- Billing (for owners)

Owners have full access. Other roles have a default permission set aligned with their responsibilities.

## Managing Roles

### Assign a Role

When inviting a member, choose a role from **Settings** → **Members**.

### Change a Role

Owners and Admins can change roles from **Settings** → **Members**.

## Best Practices

- Give most contributors **Editor** access, and reserve **Owner** access for a small number of people.
- Use **Viewer** for stakeholders who need visibility but should not change production configurations.
- Use **Evaluator** for teammates focused on running evaluations.

## FAQ

### Can I create custom roles?

Custom roles are not currently supported.

### What's the difference between Owner and Admin?

- **Owner**: Full control of the organization, including billing.
- **Admin**: Administer members and settings, without full owner privileges.
