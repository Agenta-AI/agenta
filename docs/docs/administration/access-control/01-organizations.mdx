# Organizations & Projects

Agenta organizes work around **organizations** and **projects**.

## Hierarchy

```
Organization
└── Project(s)
    └── Resources (prompts, evaluations, traces, etc.)
```

- **Organization**: Where team members, billing, and access policies reside
- **Projects**: Where you build and operate your LLM apps (prompts, evaluations, observability)

## Organizations

### Creating an Organization

Organizations are created during signup or from the organization switcher.

### Switching Organizations

If your user account is part of multiple organizations, use the organization switcher in the UI to move between them. Your role and permissions can differ per organization.

## Projects

Projects live inside an organization and contain:

- Prompt and configuration assets
- Evaluation artifacts (test sets, runs, results)
- Observability data (traces/spans)

Project creation and visibility depend on your organization role.

### Switching Projects

If your organization has multiple projects, use the project switcher in the UI to move between them. Your api keys as well as custom providers and models will differ per project.

## Managing Members

### Inviting Members

1. Navigate to **Settings** → **Members**
2. Click **Invite member**
3. Enter the email address
4. Choose a role (if RBAC is available in your organization)
5. Send the invitation

### Roles

Roles control what members can do within an organization and its projects:

| Role | Summary |
|------|---------|
| **Owner** | Full control of the organization, including billing and member management |
| **Admin** | Administer members and organization settings |
| **Editor** | Create and edit project resources |
| **Viewer** | Read-only access |
| **Evaluator** | Run and review evaluations |
| **Deployment Manager** | Manage deployments |

See [RBAC](/administration/access-control/rbac) for details.

### Changing Roles

Owners and Admins can change roles from **Settings** → **Members**.

### Removing Members

Removing a member immediately revokes access to the organization and its projects.

## Billing

Billing, subscription management, and usage tracking are linked to the organization.

## Access Policies

Organizations can configure:

- **SSO providers** (Business and Enterprise)
- **Verified domains** (Business and Enterprise)

## Troubleshooting

### Can't access an organization

Common causes:

- You're signed in with a different email than the one invited
- The organization requires SSO and you haven't completed SSO sign-in
- Your invitation expired

### Can't invite members

Common causes:

- You don't have permission (need Owner or Admin)
- You've reached member limits on your plan

## FAQ

### Can I belong to multiple organizations?

Yes. You can switch between organizations from the organization switcher.

### Can I transfer ownership?

Yes. Owners can transfer ownership to another member from organization settings.

### How many organizations can I create?

There are no limits but subscriptions and usage are per organization.
