# Organizations & Projects

Agenta organizes work around **organizations** and **projects**.

## Hierarchy

```
Organization
└── Project(s)
    └── Resources (prompts, evaluations, traces, etc.)
```

- **Organization**: Team container for members, billing, and access policies
- **Projects**: Where you build and operate your LLM apps (prompts, evaluations, observability)

## Organizations

### Creating an Organization

Organizations are created during signup or from the organization switcher.

### Switching Organizations

If your account belongs to multiple organizations, use the organization switcher in the UI to move between them. Your role and permissions can differ per organization.

## Projects

Projects live inside an organization and contain:

- Prompt and configuration assets
- Evaluation artifacts (test sets, runs, results)
- Observability data (traces/spans)

Project creation and visibility depend on your organization role.

## Managing Members

### Inviting Members

1. Navigate to **Settings** → **Members**
2. Click **Invite member**
3. Enter the email address
4. Choose a role
5. Send the invitation

### Roles

Roles control what members can do within an organization and its projects:

| Role | Summary |
|------|---------|
| **Owner** | Full control of the organization, including billing and member management |
| **Admin** | Administer members and organization settings |
| **Editor** | Create and edit project resources |
| **Viewer** | Read-only access |
| **Evaluator** | Run and review evaluations |
| **Deployment Manager** | Manage deployments |

See [RBAC](/administration/access-control/rbac) for details.

### Changing Roles

Owners and Admins can change roles from **Settings** → **Members**.

### Removing Members

Removing a member immediately revokes access to the organization and its projects.

## Billing

Billing and subscription management are linked to the organization.

## Access Policies

Organizations can configure:

- **SSO** (Business and Enterprise)
- **Domain verification** (Business and Enterprise)

## Troubleshooting

### Can't access an organization

Common causes:

- You're signed in with a different email than the one invited
- The organization requires SSO and you haven't completed SSO sign-in
- Your invitation expired

### Can't invite members

Common causes:

- You don't have permission (need Owner or Admin)
- You've reached member limits on your plan

## FAQ

### Can I belong to multiple organizations?

Yes. You can switch between organizations from the organization switcher.

### Can I transfer ownership?

Yes. Owners can transfer ownership to another member from organization settings.

### How many organizations can I create?

Limits depend on your plan. Check your billing settings or contact sales@agenta.ai.
