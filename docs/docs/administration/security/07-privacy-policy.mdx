The information we collect includes:

Depending on the device used, this device data may include information such as your IP address (or proxy server), device and application identification numbers, location, browser type, hardware model, Internet service provider and/or mobile carrier, operating system, and system configuration information. 
- _Location Data._ We collect location data such as information about your device's location, which can be either precise or imprecise.

<h2 id="legalbases">3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
**_**In Short: **We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e. , legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfill our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfill our legitimate business interests._
_**If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.**_
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information: 
- **Consent. **We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e. , consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time. Learn more about withdrawing
 your
 consent. 
- **Performance of a Contract.** We may process your personal information when we believe it is necessary to fulfill our contractual obligations to you, including providing our Services or at your request prior to entering into a contract with you. 
- **Legitimate Interests.** We may process your information when we believe it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests and those interests do not outweigh your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms.

- Send users information about special offers and discounts on our products and services 
- Analyze how our Services are used so we can improve them to engage and retain users 
- Understand how our users use our products and services so we can improve user experience

 your
 consent at any time. 
 In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without your consent, including, for example: 
- If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way 
- For investigations and fraud detection and prevention

- For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin 
- If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse 
- If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province 
- If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records 
- If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession and the collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information was produced 
- If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes 
- If the information is publicly available and is specified by the regulations 
- We may disclose de-identified information for approved research or statistics projects, subject to ethics oversight and confidentiality commitments

No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than the period of time in which users have an account with us. 
 When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

<h2 id="DNT">10. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>
**Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ( "DNT" ) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Notice. 
 California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser DNT signals. Because there currently is not an industry or legal standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we do not respond to them at this time.

When a company or organization uses our Services, we may process personal data on behalf of that customer in order to provide the Services (“Customer Data”). In those cases, the customer is the controller (or a processor acting on behalf of a controller) and Agentatech UG (haftungsbeschränkt) acts as a processor (or sub-processor). Our processing of Customer Data is governed by our Data Processing Agreement (DPA): [https://agenta.ai/docs/administration/security/dpa](https://agenta.ai/docs/administration/security/dpa) We use third-party service providers (sub-processors) to help provide the Services (for example cloud hosting, authentication, analytics, monitoring, support, email delivery, and payments). A current list of our sub-processors and their locations is available here: [https://agenta.ai/docs/administration/security/sub-processors](https://agenta.ai/docs/administration/security/sub-processors). Customer Data may be processed in countries other than where you are located, including the United States. Where required by applicable law, we rely on appropriate safeguards for international transfers, such as the EU Standard Contractual Clauses and the UK International Data Transfer Addendum, as described in our DPA.
