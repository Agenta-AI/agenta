## FAQ

### Do you send my data to LLM providers?

Agenta does not process customer data through LLM providers by default.

When you use the Playground or run evaluations:

- You bring your own LLM API keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.).
- Requests are sent directly from your browser/application to the LLM provider.
- Agenta does not store or proxy LLM API calls in typical production use.

For demo/trial purposes, Agenta may provide demo API keys. For production workloads, use your own keys.

### Does this list apply to self-hosted deployments?

No. For self-hosted deployments, you control your own infrastructure and any sub-processors you choose to use.
