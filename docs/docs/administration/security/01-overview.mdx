# Security Overview

Your prompts, evaluation data, and production traces are core IP. We built Agenta to protect them with the same rigor you'd expect from any critical infrastructure: **SOC 2 Type II certified**, **AES-256 encryption** at rest, and **data residency options** in both US and EU regions.

## Compliance

Agenta is **SOC 2 Type II** certified. For details and to request access, see our **[Trust Center](https://trustcenter.agenta.ai/)**.

## Encryption

### Data at Rest

All sensitive data stored in Agenta is encrypted at rest using **AES-256 encryption**:

- **Secrets and API keys**: Encrypted using PostgreSQL's PGP symmetric encryption (AES-256)
- **Databases and storage**: Encrypted at rest

### Data in Transit

All data transmitted to and from Agenta is encrypted using **TLS 1.2+**:

- HTTPS enforced on all endpoints
- No plaintext data transmission

## Infrastructure Security

### Cloud Infrastructure

Agenta Cloud runs on AWS with SOC 2 compliant infrastructure:

- **Network isolation**: Dedicated VPCs with public/private subnet separation
- **High availability**: Automatic failover across availability zones
- **Redundant networking**: Built-in redundancy for reliable connectivity
- **Security groups**: Principle of least privilege access rules
- **DDoS protection**: Included by default

### Access Controls

- **Role-based access control (RBAC)**: Granular permissions for organization members
- **SSO integration**: Single sign-on via OIDC (Business and Enterprise)
- **API key management**: Scoped API keys with rotation support
- **Audit logging**: Track access and changes

## Application Security

### Authentication

- **Multiple auth methods**: Email/password, social OAuth, SSO
- **Session management**: Secure session handling with automatic expiration
- **Account linking**: Safely link multiple authentication methods

### Authorization

- **Organization isolation**: Data isolated between organizations
- **Permission checks**: Every API request validated against user permissions
- **Resource scoping**: API keys scoped to your organization
