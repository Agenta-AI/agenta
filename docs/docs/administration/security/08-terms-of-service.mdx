The information provided when using the Services is not intended for distribution to or use by any person or entity in any jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or regulation or which would subject us to any registration requirement within such jurisdiction or country.

The Services are not tailored to comply with industry-specific regulations (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), etc.). If your use of the Services is subject to such laws, you should not use the Services unless we have agreed in writing to additional terms addressing those requirements.

## 11. PRIVACY POLICY

We care about data privacy and security. Please review our Privacy Policy: https://agenta.ai/docs/administration/security/privacy-policy. We act as a controller for personal data we process for our own purposes (for example, website, billing, and service telemetry) as described in the Privacy Policy.

Customer Data (Agenta as Processor)

If you use the Services on behalf of a company or other organization, we may process personal data on behalf of that entity in order to provide the Services ("Customer Data"). In this context, the customer is the controller (or a processor acting on behalf of a controller) and we act as a processor (or sub-processor). Our processing of Customer Data is governed by our Data Processing Agreement (DPA), which is incorporated into these Legal Terms by reference: https://agenta.ai/docs/administration/security/dpa. If there is any conflict between the DPA and these Legal Terms with respect to Customer Data, the DPA will control.

Sub-processors

We use third-party service providers (sub-processors) to help us provide the Services. A current list of our sub-processors and their locations is available here: https://agenta.ai/docs/administration/security/sub-processors.

International transfers

Customer Data may be processed in countries other than where you are located, including the United States. Where required by applicable law, we rely on appropriate safeguards for international transfers, such as the EU Standard Contractual Clauses and the UK International Data Transfer Addendum, as described in our DPA.

## 12. TERM AND TERMINATION

These Legal Terms shall remain in full force and effect while you use the Services. WITHOUT LIMITING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THESE LEGAL TERMS, WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO, IN OUR SOLE DISCRETION AND WITHOUT NOTICE OR LIABILITY, DENY ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE SERVICES (INCLUDING BLOCKING CERTAIN IP ADDRESSES), TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY REASON OR FOR NO REASON, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION FOR BREACH OF ANY REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, OR COVENANT CONTAINED IN THESE LEGAL TERMS OR OF ANY APPLICABLE LAW OR REGULATION. WE MAY TERMINATE YOUR USE OR PARTICIPATION IN THE SERVICES OR DELETE YOUR ACCOUNT AND ANY CONTENT OR INFORMATION THAT YOU POSTED AT ANY TIME, WITHOUT WARNING, IN OUR SOLE DISCRETION.

For paid subscriptions, we will use reasonable efforts to provide a reasonable opportunity to export Customer Data prior to deletion, except where prohibited by law or where immediate action is required to protect the Services or other users.

Termination and deletion of Customer Data are subject to Section 20 and, where applicable, the DPA.

If we terminate or suspend your account for any reason, you are prohibited from registering and creating a new account under your name, a fake or borrowed name, or the name of any third party, even if you may be acting on behalf of the third party. In addition to terminating or suspending your account, we reserve the right to take appropriate legal action, including without limitation pursuing civil, criminal, and injunctive redress.

## 13. MODIFICATIONS AND INTERRUPTIONS

We reserve the right to change, modify, or remove the contents of the Services at any time or for any reason at our sole discretion without notice.

We cannot guarantee the Services will be available at all times. We may experience hardware, software, or other problems or need to perform maintenance related to the Services, resulting in interruptions, delays, or errors. We reserve the right to change, revise, update, suspend, discontinue, or otherwise modify the Services at any time or for any reason without notice to you. You agree that we have no liability whatsoever for any loss, damage, or inconvenience caused by your inability to access or use the Services during any downtime or discontinuance of the Services. Nothing in these Legal Terms will be construed to obligate us to maintain and support the Services or to supply any corrections, updates, or releases in connection therewith.

## 14. GOVERNING LAW

These Legal Terms are governed by and interpreted following the laws of Germany, and the use of the United Nations Convention of Contracts for the International Sales of Goods is expressly excluded. If your habitual residence is in the EU, and you are a consumer, you additionally possess the protection provided to you by obligatory provisions of the law in your country of residence.

## 15. DISPUTE RESOLUTION

If you have entered into a separate written agreement with us for the Services, the dispute resolution provisions in that agreement will control to the extent they conflict with this Section 15.

You and Agentatech UG (haftungsbeschraenkt) agree to submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Berlin, Germany. If you are a consumer habitually resident in the EU, you may also bring a claim to enforce your consumer protection rights in the courts of your country of residence.

Nothing in these Legal Terms prevents either party from seeking injunctive or equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction.

## 16. CORRECTIONS

There may be information on the Services that contains typographical errors, inaccuracies, or omissions, including descriptions, pricing, availability, and various other information.

AS WITH THE PURCHASE OF A PRODUCT OR SERVICE THROUGH ANY MEDIUM OR IN ANY ENVIRONMENT, YOU SHOULD USE YOUR BEST JUDGMENT AND EXERCISE CAUTION WHERE APPROPRIATE.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, we reserve the right, at your expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter for which you are required to indemnify us, and you agree to cooperate, at your expense, with our defense of such claims. We will use reasonable efforts to notify you of any such claim, action, or proceeding which is subject to this indemnification upon becoming aware of it.

## 20. USER DATA

You retain all rights to the data, content, and other information you or your authorized users submit to the Services ("Customer Data"). As described in the DPA, we process Customer Data on your behalf to provide the Services.

## 21. ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS, TRANSACTIONS, AND SIGNATURES

You consent to receive electronic communications, and you agree that all agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications we provide to you electronically, via email and on the Services, satisfy any legal requirement that such communication be in writing.

## 23. MISCELLANEOUS

Order of precedence

If you have entered into a separate written agreement with us for the Services, that agreement will control to the extent it conflicts with these Legal Terms. If you are subject to our DPA, the DPA will control to the extent it conflicts with these Legal Terms with respect to Customer Data.

These Legal Terms and any policies or operating rules posted by us on the Services or in respect to the Services constitute the entire agreement and understanding between you and us. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Legal Terms shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. These Legal Terms operate to the fullest extent permissible by law. We may assign any or all of our rights and obligations to others at any time. We shall not be responsible or liable for any loss, damage, delay, or failure to act caused by any cause beyond our reasonable control. If any provision or part of a provision of these Legal Terms is determined to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision is deemed severable from these Legal Terms and does not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. There is no joint venture, partnership, employment or agency relationship created between you and us as a result of these Legal Terms or use of the Services. You agree that these Legal Terms will not be construed against us by virtue of having drafted them. You hereby waive any and all defenses you may have based on the electronic form of these Legal Terms and the lack of signing by the parties hereto to execute these Legal Terms.

## 24. RESTRICTION ON AI MODEL TRAINING

Agentatech will not use Customer Data to train, fine-tune, or otherwise improve any machine-learning or large-language models.
