## LLM Providers

Agenta does not process your data through LLM providers by default.

When you use the playground or run evaluations:

- You provide your own API keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- Requests go directly from your browser or application to the LLM provider
- Agenta does not store or proxy these requests

For trial purposes, Agenta may provide demo API keys. Use your own keys for production workloads.

## Self-Hosted

This list applies to **Agenta Cloud** only. Self-hosted customers control their own infrastructure and sub-processors.

## Changes

We may update this list as our infrastructure evolves. Material changes will be communicated to customers with active subscriptions.
