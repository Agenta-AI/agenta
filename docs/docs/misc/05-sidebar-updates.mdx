Agenta can display short update notifications in the sidebar. These cards keep users informed about new functionality and link to the full changelog for details.

Each card includes a "What's new" tag and a close icon so users can dismiss the message permanently.

## Adding an update

Update data lives in `web/ee/src/components/SidePanel/assets/updates.ts`. Each entry has an `id`, a `title`, a short `description` and an optional `link` pointing to the changelog.

```ts
export const SIDEBAR_UPDATES = [
  {
    id: '2025-05-15-annotations',
    title: 'Annotate responses',
    description: 'Capture user feedback with new annotation API.',
    link: '/changelog/main#annotate-your-llm-response-preview',
  },
]
```

Entries should be ordered from newest to oldest. When a user closes an update card, it will not be shown again. If multiple updates are available, they are shown one after another from the most recent to the oldest.

While an update card is visible, the sidebar hides the default **Free Plan** banner. Once all updates are dismissed, the banner returns as usual.
