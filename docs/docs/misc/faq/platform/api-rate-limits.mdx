Agenta applies rate limits per organization to ensure fair usage and system stability. Limits vary by plan and endpoint type.

Each limit has two values. Burst is the maximum number of requests that can be served at once. Rate is the sustained number of requests per minute.

| Endpoint Type | Example | Free | Pro | Business | Enterprise |
|---------------|---------|------|-----|----------|------------|
| Trace ingestion | `POST /otlp/v1/traces` | 1,200 / 1,200 per min | 3,600 / 3,600 per min | 36,000 / 36,000 per min | Custom |
| Data retrieval | `POST */retrieve` | 1,200 / 1,200 per min | 3,600 / 3,600 per min | 36,000 / 36,000 per min | Custom |
| Queries and analytics | `POST /tracing/*/query` | 120 / 1 per min | 180 / 1 per min | 1,800 / 1 per min | Custom |
| Other endpoints | General API calls | 120 / 120 per min | 360 / 360 per min | 3,600 / 3,600 per min | Custom |

## Rate limit response

When you exceed the rate limit, the API returns `429 Too Many Requests`.

```json
{
  "detail": "Rate limit exceeded. Please retry after 5 seconds."
}
```

The response includes headers that help you back off:

| Header | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `X-RateLimit-Limit` | Maximum requests allowed (burst capacity) |
| `X-RateLimit-Remaining` | Remaining requests in the current window |
| `Retry-After` | Seconds to wait before retrying. Only returned on 429 responses. |

Successful responses also include `X-RateLimit-Remaining`.
