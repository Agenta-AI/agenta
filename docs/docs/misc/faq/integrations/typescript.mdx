:::info
The same described here applies to other languages like JavaScript, Java, and Go. Agenta's API first approach enables integration with virtually any programming language.
:::

Yes, Agenta can be used with TypeScript, though with varying levels of native support.

## Prompt management

We do not currently provide a native TypeScript SDK for prompt management. You can use the API directly. See the [API Reference](/reference/api/variants).

## Observability

Agenta is OpenTelemetry compliant. You can auto instrument your TypeScript application using OpenTelemetry integrations such as [OpenLLMetry](https://github.com/traceloop/openllmetry-js).

See [setting up OpenTelemetry](/observability/trace-with-opentelemetry/distributed-tracing#opentelemetry-tracing-without-agenta-sdk).

## Evaluation

You can evaluate prompts created in the UI. For custom workflows (agentic applications), we currently support Python in the playground.

A practical workaround is to create a small Python wrapper that calls your TypeScript endpoint and then run evaluations against that wrapper from Agenta.
