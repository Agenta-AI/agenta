## Our Approach

Agenta follows an open-core model. All functional features—including prompt management, observability, evaluations, and custom workflows—are fully open source (MIT-licensed), giving you complete flexibility and control. Commercial features focus on enterprise needs like team management, support, and enterprise-specific capabilities.

We believe this approach offers the best balance. It gives you the freedom to use all functional features without restrictions while allowing us to maintain a sustainable business model through enterprise services and support. 

### Why Open Source?

Open source matters for an LLMOps platform like Agenta because it gives you:

1. **Flexibility**: Modify and customize the software to fit your needs.
2. **Independence**: Avoid vendor lock-in, ensuring long-term project continuity.
3. **Community Support**: Benefit from contributions and shared improvements from the community.

### License Information

The Agenta open-core is licensed under the MIT license. Everything in our public repositories is open source, with no closed-source components included. All SDKs, client libraries, and APIs are fully open source under MIT. You can self-host it, modify it, and use it in commercial projects without restrictions.

Enterprise features (like team management, support, and custom SSO) are available through our [free and paid plans](https://agenta.ai/pricing), either in our cloud service or as an enterprise self-hosted solution.
