## Our Approach

Agenta follows an open-core model. The core platform is fully open source (MIT-licensed), giving you flexibility and control. Commercial features provide advanced functionality and support.

We believe this approach offers the best balance. It gives you the freedom to use our core features without restrictions while allowing us to maintain a sustainable business model. 

### Why Open Source?

Open source matters for an LLMOps platform like Agenta because it gives you:

1. **Flexibility**: Modify and customize the software to fit your needs.
2. **Independence**: Avoid vendor lock-in, ensuring long-term project continuity.
3. **Community Support**: Benefit from contributions and shared improvements from the community.

### License Information

The Agenta open-core is licensed under the MIT license. Everything in our public repositories is open source, with no closed-source components included. All SDKs, client libraries, and APIs are fully open source under MIT. You can self-host it, modify it, and use it in commercial projects without restrictions.

Advanced features (like evaluations, monitoring, and team management) are available through our [free and paid plans](https://agenta.ai/pricing), either in our cloud service or as an enterprise self-hosted solution.
