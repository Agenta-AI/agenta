# Status: Agents Feature

> Last updated: 2026-01-29

## Current Phase

**Research & Scoping**

## What's Done

- [x] Created planning workspace scaffold
- [x] Defined initial research areas

## In Progress

- [ ] Scope and PRD research
- [ ] Tools integration research (Composio, etc.)
- [ ] Playground tools support research
- [ ] Agent frameworks research

## Blockers

None currently.

## Recent Decisions

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2026-01-29 | Start with research phase | Feature scope unclear, need exploration |

## Next Steps

1. Research scope boundaries - what is an "agent" in Agenta?
2. Investigate Composio and other tool integration options
3. Analyze how playground currently handles completions/chat
4. Survey minimal agent frameworks

## Open Questions

- What's the minimum viable agent feature?
- Build tools integration vs. integrate existing providers?
- How does tool calling affect the playground UX?
- Do we need a framework or can we build minimal?
