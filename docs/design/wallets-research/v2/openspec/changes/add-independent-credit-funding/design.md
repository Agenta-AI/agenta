## Context

This change extends the original allowance and Stripe discussions with Mahmoud's confirmed independent-top-up requirement. Stripe owns monetary price/currency and payment state; Agenta maps the immutable purchased package version to credited value. Existing entitlements own lifetime platform access. Recurring credit allowance, included sandbox quantity and package purchase are separate settings. No marketplace or final prices are chosen. Operator-only validated configuration can precede an admin editor; changes need version/effective-date history.

## Goals / Non-Goals

Implement only the capability boundaries described here after separate implementation authorization. Do not create another ledger, replace existing entitlements, or require every backlog item for one release. Numeric examples are synthetic, not approved prices.

## Decisions

Reuse organization identity, permissions, secrets, entitlements, meters, wallet accounting and measurement infrastructure. A plan entitlement is not an active Stripe subscription. Keep provider credentials server-side and separate policy, routing, request data, usage facts, and financial records.

## Risks / Trade-offs

Concurrent execution, duplicate events, expired value, unknown provider outcomes and delayed measurements can create incorrect balances if treated as ordinary request retries. Validate enabled behavior against exact source revisions and provider evidence. Passing OpenSpec validation is not runtime evidence.

## Migration Plan

Land focused changes behind independent controls. Preserve existing credentials and balances. Test flag-off and open-source behavior. Enable only the approved subset with monitoring and rollback; never erase financial history to roll back behavior.

## Open Questions

See ../../../decision-register.md for unresolved policy and technical choices. Resolve only those needed by the selected implementation slice. Do not infer approval of a price, provider, expiry, or overage policy from this specification.
