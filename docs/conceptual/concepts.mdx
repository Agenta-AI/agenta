## App
An app, is a Language Model (llm) powered application that can be deployed through Agenta. It's essentially a collection of code and configurations designed to perform specific tasks. For example, an app might be created to summarize YouTube videos or to translate text from one language to another.

## App Variant
An app variant is a version of an app that operates with a different set of parameters, or even different code, while maintaining the same inputs and outputs. Variants allow users to experiment with different approaches or configurations within the same app. For instance, one variant of a text translation app might use one translation model while another variant uses a different model.

## App Inputs
App inputs are the data that an app requires to function. They provide the raw material on which the app performs its tasks. For a YouTube video summarizing app, the input would be a YouTube video URL.

## Templates

Templates are reusable LLM-powered applications that you can start your code with and build upon. 
At the time of writing, there is only one template available `simple_prompt` which is a simple prompt-based application developed in langchain.
In the future we plan to add a multitude of templates for different use cases (e.g. simple chatbot, classification app, chat with your PDB app, etc.) using a multitude of libraries (langchain, llma_index, guardrails, etc.) and LLMs (gpt-4, cohere, huggingface, etc.)

You can use a template when you start your project from CLI:

```bash
agenta init
```

## App Parameters
App parameters are options or settings that affect the behavior of an app. They are typically set before running the app and remain constant throughout a particular execution. For example, in a text summarization app, the 'prompt_template' parameter might control the style of the summary, while the 'method' parameter could determine the summarization algorithm used. Parameters add a layer of flexibility and customization to the app's function, allowing for different variants of the same app.

## App Outputs
App outputs are the results produced by the app after processing the inputs. For the YouTube video summarizing app, the output would be a text summary of the video.

## Evaluation Table
An evaluation table in Agenta is a table that contains the results of various runs or variants of an app. Each row in this table, referred to as an evaluation row, represents a single run or variant of the app, displaying the inputs, parameters, and outputs for that specific run.

## Playground
The playground in Agenta is a user-friendly interface where users can create and test new variants of an app. In the playground, users can adjust parameters, provide inputs, and view the output that their app produces.
