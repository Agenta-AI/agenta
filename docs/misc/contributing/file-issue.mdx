Filing an issue is an important step in helping us improve our project. Please follow these steps and provide the requested information when reporting an issue.

## Reporting a Bug

### Bug Report Template

We have a bug report template that you can use to report issues. It includes fields for describing the bug, steps to reproduce it, and additional information.

Create an issue to report a bug by clicking [here](https://github.com/Agenta-AI/agenta/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=bug_report.md&title=) and fill in the required information to help us better understand the bug.

## Providing Additional Information

To help us diagnose and resolve the issue quickly, please follow these steps:

1. **Network Logs in the Browser:**

   - Open your browser's developer console (usually by pressing F12 or right-clicking and selecting "Inspect").
   <img height="600" src="/images/creating-issue/inspect-network-1.png" />

   - Navigate to the "Network" tab.
   <img height="600" src="/images/creating-issue/inspect-network-2.png" />

   - Reproduce the issue by triggering what caused it before and all the requests made will be logged in the Networks tab.
   - Take a screenshot of the network logs or copy and paste any relevant log entries.

   - In particular you can open a specific request, maybe the one has returned 404 or 400 or 500, then click on response and show take a screenshot of it. 
   <img height="600" src="/images/creating-issue/inspect-network-4.png" />
   <img height="600" src="/images/creating-issue/inspect-network-5.png" />

2. **Docker Containers Information:**

   - If you're using Docker, open Docker Desktop (if available) or use the terminal/command line and run the command;

   ```bash
   docker ps -a
   ```

   - Provide a screenshot showing the list of running and stopped containers.
   <img height="600" src="/images/creating-issue/docker-log-1.png" />
   <img height="600" src="/images/creating-issue/docker-log-terminal.png" />

   - If your issue is associated with a specific llm app;

     - On Docker Desktop, open the container of that llm app and provide a screenshot of it.
       The Container name would start with the name of your llm app, followed by the app variant name (If you've created more than one variant).

       <img height="600" src="/images/creating-issue/docker-log-llm-app.png" />

     - In terminal/command line, run the command below and provide a screenshot of it;

   ```bash
   docker logs CONTAINER_NAME_OR_ID
   ```

   {" "}
   <img
     height="600"
     src="/images/creating-issue/docker-log-terminal-llm-app.png"
   />

   You can get the Container name or ID by running the previous command `docker ps -a`

   - For the agenta-backend container, provide the logs;
     - by running: `docker logs agenta-backend` and include the output, or more importantly provide a screenshot of it.
     - by opening the container in Docker Desktop and providing a screenshot of it.
       <img
         height="600"
         src="/images/creating-issue/docker-log-agenta-backend.png"
       />

By providing these details, you help us pinpoint the problem and work towards a resolution more efficiently.
