### Observability and Prompt Management

_6 November 2024_

**v0.27.0**

This release is one of our biggest yet—one changelog hardly does it justice.

**First up: Observability**

We’ve had observability in beta for a while, but now it’s been completely rewritten,
with a brand-new UI and fully **open-source code**.

The new [Observability SDK](/observability/overview) is compatible with [OpenTelemetry (Otel)](https://opentelemetry.io/) and [gen-ai semantic conventions](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/gen-ai/). This means you get a lot of integrations right out of the box, like [LangChain](/observability/integrations/langchain), [OpenAI](/observability/integrations/openai), and more.

We’ll publish a full blog post soon, but here’s a quick look at what the new observability offers:

- A redesigned UI that lets you visualize nested traces, making it easier to understand what’s happening behind the scenes.

- The web UI lets you filter traces by name, cost, and other attributes—you can even search through them easily.

- The SDK is Otel-compatible, and we’ve already tested integrations for [OpenAI](/observability/integrations/openai), [LangChain](/observability/integrations/langchain), [LiteLLM](/observability/integrations/litellm), and [Instructor](/observability/integrations/instructor), with guides available for each. In most cases, adding a few lines of code will have you seeing traces directly in Agenta.

**Next: Prompt Management**

We’ve completely rewritten the [prompt management SDK](/prompt-management/overview), giving you full CRUD capabilities for prompts and configurations. This includes creating, updating, reading history, deploying new versions, and deleting old ones. You can find a first tutorial for this [here](/tutorials/sdk/manage-prompts-with-SDK).

**And finally: LLM-as-a-Judge Overhaul**

We’ve made significant upgrades to the [LLM-as-a-Judge evaluator](/evaluation/evaluators/llm-as-a-judge). It now supports prompts with multiple messages and has access to all variables in a test case. You can also switch models (currently supporting OpenAI and Anthropic). These changes make the evaluator much more flexible, and we’re seeing better results with it.

### New Application Management View and Various Improvements

_22 October 2024_

**v0.26.0**

We updated the **Application Management View** to improve the UI. Many users struggled to find their applications when they had a large number, so we've improved the view and added a search bar for quick filtering.
Additionally, we are moving towards a new project structure for the application. We moved test sets and evaluators outside of the application scope. So now, you can use the same test set and evaluators in multiple applications.

**Bug Fixes**

- Added an export button in the evaluation view to export results from the main view.
- Eliminated Pydantic warnings in the CLI.
- Improved error messages when `fetch_config` is called with wrong arguments.
- Enhanced the custom code evaluation sandbox and removed the limitation that results need to be between 0 and 1

### Evaluator Testing Playground and a New Evaluation View

_22 September 2024_

**v0.25.0**

<Stream controls src="41941e8e6b5a119faa5ced10af891f86" height="400px" />
<br />
Many users faced challenges configuring evaluators in the web UI. Some
evaluators, such as `LLM as a judge`, `custom code`, or RAG evaluators can be
tricky to set up correctly on the first try. Until now, users needed to setup,
run an evaluation, check the errors, then do it again.

To address this, we've introduced a new evaluator test/debug playground. This feature allows you to test the evaluator live on real data, helping you test the configuration before committing to it and using it for evaluations.

Additionally, we have improved and redesigned the evaluation view. Both automatic and human evaluations are now within the same view but in different tabs. We're moving towards unifying all evaluator results and consolidating them in one view, allowing you to quickly get an overview of what's working.

---

### UI Redesign and Configuration Management and Overview View

_22 August 2024_

**v0.24.0**

<div>
  <Image
    img={require("/images/changelog/new_ui.png")}
    alt="Button for exporting evaluation results"
    style={{
      display: "block",
      margin: "5px auto",
      width: "80%",
      textAlign: "center",
    }}
  />
</div>

We've completely redesigned the platform's UI. Additionally we have introduced a new overview view for your applications. This is part of a series of upcoming improvements slated for the next few weeks.

The new overview view offers:

- A dashboard displaying key metrics of your application
- A table with all the variants of your applications
- A summary of your application's most recent evaluations

We've also added a new **JSON Diff evaluator**. This evaluator compares two JSON objects and provides a similarity score.

Lastly, we've updated the UI of our documentation.

---

### New Alpha Version of the SDK for Creating Custom Applications

_20 August 2024_

**v0.23.0**

We've released a new version of the SDK for creating custom applications. This Pydantic-based SDK significantly simplifies the process of building custom applications. It's fully backward compatible, so your existing code will continue to work seamlessly. We'll soon be rolling out comprehensive documentation and examples for the new SDK.

In the meantime, here's a quick example of how to use it:

```python
import agenta as ag
from agenta import Agenta
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

#highlight-start
ag.init()
#highlight-end

# Define the configuration of the application (that will be shown in the playground )
#highlight-start
class MyConfig(BaseModel):
    temperature: float = Field(default=0.2)
    prompt_template: str = Field(default="What is the capital of {country}?")
#highlight-end

# Creates an endpoint for the entrypoint of the application
#highlight-start
@ag.route("/", config_schema=MyConfig)
#highlight-end
def generate(country: str) -> str:
    # Fetch the config from the request
    #highlight-start
    config: MyConfig = ag.ConfigManager.get_from_route(schema=MyConfig)
    #highlight-end
    prompt = config.prompt_template.format(country=country)
    chat_completion = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
        temperature=config.temperature,
    )
    return chat_completion.choices[0].message.content

```

### RAGAS Evaluators and Traces in the Playground

_12 August 2024_

**v0.22.0**

We're excited to announce two major features this week:

1. We've integrated [RAGAS evaluators](https://docs.ragas.io/) into agenta. Two new evaluators have been added: **RAG Faithfulness** (measuring how consistent the LLM output is with the context) and **Context Relevancy** (assessing how relevant the retrieved context is to the question). Both evaluators use intermediate outputs within the trace to calculate the final score.

   [Check out the tutorial](/evaluation/evaluators/rag-evaluators) to learn how to use RAG evaluators.

{" "}

<div>
  <Image
    img={require("/images/changelog/rag_faithfulness.png")}
    alt="Button for exporting evaluation results"
    style={{ width: "80%", maxWidth: "800px" }}
  />
</div>

2. You can now **view traces directly in the playground**. This feature enables you to debug your application while configuring it—for example, by examining the prompts sent to the LLM or reviewing intermediate outputs.

   <div>
     <Image
       img={require("/images/changelog/trace_in_playground.png")}
       alt="Button for exporting evaluation results"
       style={{ width: "80%", maxWidth: "800px" }}
     />
   </div>

:::note
Both features are available exclusively in the cloud and enterprise versions of agenta.

### Migration from MongoDB to Postgres

_9 July 2024_

**v0.19.0**

We have migrated the Agenta database from MongoDB to Postgres. As a result, the **platform is much more faster** (up to 10x in some use cases).

However, if you are self-hosting agenta, note that this is a breaking change that requires you to manually migrate your data from MongoDB to Postgres. You can find more information how to migrate your data [here](/self-host/migration/migration-to-postgres).

If you are using the cloud version of Agenta, there is nothing you need to do (other than enjoying the new performance improvements).

---

### More Reliable Evaluations

_5 July 2024_

**v0.18.0**

<div>
  <Image
    img={require("/images/changelog/export_evaluation.png")}
    alt="Button for exporting evaluation results"
    style={{ width: "80%", maxWidth: "800px" }}
  />
</div>

We have worked extensively on improving the **reliability of evaluations**. Specifically:

- We improved the status for evaluations and added a new `Queued` status
- We improved the error handling in evaluations. Now we show the exact error message that caused the evaluation to fail.
- We fixed issues that caused evaluations to run infinitely
- We fixed issues in the calculation of scores in human evaluations.
- We fixed small UI issues with large output in human evaluations.
- We have added a new export button in the evaluation view to export the results as a CSV file.

Additionally, we have added a new [Cookbook for run evaluation using the SDK](/tutorials/sdk/evaluate-with-SDK).

In **observability**:

- We have added a **new integration with [Litellm](https://litellm.ai/)** to automatically trace all LLM calls done through it.
- Now we automatically propagate cost and token usage from spans to traces.

---

### Evaluators can access all columns

_4 June 2024_

**v0.17.0**

<div>
  <Image
    img={require("/images/changelog/configure_expected_answer.png")}
    alt="Configure Expected Answer"
    style={{ width: "70%", maxWidth: "800px" }}
  />
</div>

Evaluators now can access all columns in the test set. Previously, you were limited to using only the `correct_answer` column for the ground truth / reference answer in evaluation.
Now you can configure your evaluator to use any column in the test set as the ground truth. To do that, open the collapsable `Advanced Settings` when configuring the evaluator, and define the `Expected Answer Column` to the name of the columns containing the reference answer you want to use.

In addition to this:

- We've upgraded the SDK to pydantic v2.
- We have improved by 10x the speed for the get config endpoint
- We have add documentation for observability

---

### New LLM Provider: Welcome Gemini!

_25 May 2024_

**v0.14.14**

We are excited to announce the addition of Google's Gemini to our list of supported LLM providers, bringing the total number to 12.

<Image img={require("/images/changelog/gemini_screenshot.png")} />

---

### Playground Improvements

_24 May 2024_

**v0.14.1-13**

- We've improved the workflow for adding outputs to a dataset in the playground. In the past, you had to select the name of the test set each time. Now, the last used test set is selected by default..
  <Image
    img={require("/images/changelog/default-selected-testset_video.gif")}
  />
- We have significantly improved the debugging experience when creating applications from code. Now, if an application fails, you can view the logs to understand the reason behind the failure.
- We moved the copy message button in the playground to the output text area.
- We now hide the cost and usage in the playground when they aren't specified
- We've made improvements to error messages in the playground

**Bug Fixes**

- Fixed the order of the arguments when running a custom code evaluator
- Fixed the timestamp in the Testset view (previous stamps was droppping the trailing 0)
- Fixed the creation of application from code in the self-hosted version when using Windows

---

### Prompt and Configuration Registry

_1 May 2024_

**v0.14.0**

We've introduced a feature that allows you to use Agenta as a prompt registry or management system. In the deployment view, we now provide an endpoint to directly fetch the latest version of your prompt. Here is how it looks like:

```

from agenta import Agenta
agenta = Agenta()
config = agenta.get_config(base_id="xxxxx", environment="production", cache_timeout=200) # Fetches the configuration with caching

```

You can find additional documentation [here](/prompt-management/integration/how-to-integrate-with-agenta).

**Improvements**

- Previously, publishing a variant from the playground to an environment was a manual process., from now on we are publishing by default to the production environment.
  <Image
    img={require("/images/changelog/publish_to_production_by_default_screenshot.png")}
  />

---

### Miscellaneous Improvements

_28 April 2024_

**v0.13.8**

---

### Observability (beta)

_14th April 2024_

**v0.13.0**

You can now monitor your application usage in production. We've added a new observability feature (currently in beta), which allows you to:

- Monitor cost, latency, and the number of calls to your applications in real-time.
- View the logs of your LLM calls, including inputs, outputs, and used configurations. You can also add any interesting logs to your test set.
- Trace your more complex LLM applications to understand the logic within and debug it.

As of now, all new applications created will include observability by default. We are working towards a GA version in the next weeks, which will be scalable and better integrated with your applications. We will also be adding tutorials and documentation about it.

**Running Evaluations**

1. Simultaneous Evaluations: You can now run multiple evaluations for different app variants and evaluators concurrently.

<Image img={require("/images/changelog/eval_1.png")} />

2. Rate Limit Parameters: Specify these during evaluations and reattempts to ensure reliable results without exceeding open AI rate limits.

<Image img={require("/images/changelog/eval_2.png")} />

3. Reusable Evaluators: Configure evaluators such as similarity match, regex match, or AI critique and use them across multiple evaluations.

<Image img={require("/images/changelog/eval_3.png")} />

**Evaluation Reports**

### Adding Cost and Token Usage to the Playground

_12th January 2024_

**v0.7.1**

:::caution
This change requires you to pull the latest version of the agenta platform if you're using the self-serve version.
:::

<Image img={require("/images/changelog/screenshot_cost_and_token_usage.png")} />

We've added a feature that allows you to compare the time taken by an LLM app, its cost, and track token usage, all in one place.

----#

### Changes to the SDK

This necessitated modifications to the SDK. Now, the LLM application API returns a JSON instead of a string. The JSON includes the output message, usage details, and cost:

```

{
"message": string,
"usage": {
"prompt_tokens": int,
"completion_tokens": int,
"total_tokens": int
},
"cost": float
}

```
