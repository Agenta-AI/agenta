### [Vertex AI Provider Support](/changelog/vertex-ai-provider-support)

_24 October 2025_

**v0.59.6**

We've added support for Google Cloud's Vertex AI platform. You can now use Gemini models and other Vertex AI partner models in the playground, configure them in the Model Hub, and access them through the Gateway using InVoke endpoints.

Check out the documentation for [configuring Vertex AI models](/prompt-engineering/playground/adding-custom-providers#configuring-vertex-ai).

### [Filtering Traces by Annotation](/changelog/filtering-traces-by-annotation)

_14 October 2025_

**v0.58.0**
<Image img={require('/static/images/changelog/changelog-annotation-filter.png')} alt="Annotation filtering interface" style={{display: 'block', margin: '20px auto', textAlign: 'center'}} />


You can now filter and search traces based on their annotations. This helps you find traces with low scores or bad feedback quickly.

We rebuilt the filtering system in observability with a simpler dropdown and more options. You can now filter by span status, input keys, app or environment references, and any key within your span.

The new annotation filtering lets you find:
- Spans evaluated by a specific evaluator
- Spans with user feedback like `success=True`


This enables powerful workflows: [capture user feedback](/tutorials/cookbooks/capture-user-feedback) from your app, filter to find traces with bad feedback, add them to test sets, and improve your prompts based on real user data.

### [New Evaluation Results Dashboard](/changelog/new-evaluation-results-dashboard)

_26 September 2025_

**v0.54.0**

We've completely redesigned the evaluation results dashboard. You can analyse your evaluation results more easily and understand performance across different metrics.

Here's what's new:

- **Metrics plots**: We've added plots for all the evaluator metrics. You can not see the distribution of the results and easily spot outliers.
- **Side-by-side comparison**: You can now compare multiple evaluations simultaneously. You can compare the plots but also the single outputs.
- **Improved test cases view**: The results are now displayed in a tabular format works both for small and large datasets.
- **Focused detail view**: A new focused drawer lets you examine individual data points in more details. It's very helpful if your data is large.
- **Configuration view**: See exactly which configurations were used in each evaluation
- **Evaluation Run naming and descriptions**: Add names and descriptions to your evaluation runs to organize things better.

### [Deep URL Support for Sharable Links](/changelog/deep-url-support-for-sharable-links)

_24 September 2025_

**v0.53.0**

URLs across Agenta now include workspace context, making them fully shareable between team members. Previously, URLs would always point to the default workspace, causing issues when refreshing pages or sharing links.

Now you can deep link to almost anything in the platform - prompts, evaluations, and more - in any workspace. Share links directly with team members and they'll see exactly what you intended, regardless of their default workspace settings.

### [Major Speed Improvements and Bug Fixes](/changelog/speed-improvements-in-the-playground)

_19 September 2025_

**v0.52.5**

We rewrote most of Agenta's frontend. You'll see much faster speeds when you create prompts or use the playground.

We also made many improvements and fixed bugs:

**Improvements:**

- [LLM-as-a-judge](/evaluation/evaluators/llm-as-a-judge) now uses double curly braces `{{}}` instead of single curly braces `{` and `}`. This matches how normal prompts work. Old LLM-as-a-judge prompts with single curly braces still work. We updated the LLM-as-a-judge playground to make editing prompts easier.

**Self-hosting:**

- You can now use [an external Redis instance](/self-host/configuration#redis-caching) for caching by setting it as an environment variable

**Bug fixes:**

- Fixed the [custom workflow quick start tutorial](/custom-workflows/quick-start) and examples
- Fixed SDK compatibility issues with Python 3.9
- Fixed default filtering in observability dashboard
- Fixed error handling in the evaluator playground
- Fixed the Tracing SDK to allow instrumenting streaming responses and overriding OTEL environment variables

### [Multiple Metrics in Human Evaluation](/changelog/multiple-metrics-in-human-evaluation)

_9 September 2025_

**v0.51.0**

We rebuilt the human evaluation workflow from scratch. Now you can set multiple evaluators and metrics and use them to score the outputs. 

This lets you evaluate the same output on different metrics like **relevance** or **completeness**. You can also create binary, numerical scores, or even use strings for **comments** or **expected answer**. 

Watch the video below and read the [post](/changelog/multiple-metrics-in-human-evaluation) for more details. Or check out the [docs](/evaluation/human_evaluation) to learn how to use the new human evaluation workflow.

### [Open-sourcing our Product Roadmap](/roadmap)

_12 August 2025_

We've made our product roadmap completely transparent and community-driven.

You can now see exactly what we're building, what's shipped, and what's coming next. Plus vote on features that matter most to you.

**Why we're doing this:** We believe open-source startups succeed when they create the most value possible, and the best way to do that is by building with our community, not in isolation. Up until now, we've been secretive with our roadmap, but we're losing something important: your feedback and the ability to let you shape our direction. Today we're open-sourcing our roadmap because we want to build a community of owners, not just passive users.

### [LlamaIndex Integration](/changelog/llamaindex-integration)
_17 June 2025_
**v0.48.4**

We're excited to announce observability support for LlamaIndex applications.

If you're using LlamaIndex, you can now see detailed traces in Agenta to debug your application.

The integration is auto-instrumentation - just add one line of code and you'll start seeing all your LlamaIndex operations traced.

This helps when you need to understand what's happening inside your RAG pipeline, track performance bottlenecks, or debug issues in production.

We've put together a Jupyter notebook and tutorial to get you started. Links are in the comments.

### [Annotate Your LLM Response (preview)](/changelog/annotate-your-llm-response-preview)
_15 May 2025_
**v0.45.0**

One of the major feature requests we had was the ability to capture user feedback and annotations (e.g. scores) to LLM responses traced in Agenta. 

Today we're previewing one of a family of features around this topic. 

As of today you can use the annotation API to add annotations to LLM responses traced in Agenta. 

This is useful to:
- Collect user feedback on LLM responses
- Run custom evaluation workflows
- Measure application performance in real-time

Check out the how to [annotate traces from API](/evaluation/annotate-api) for more details. Or try our new tutorial (available as [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/Agenta-AI/agenta/blob/main/examples/jupyter/capture_user_feedback.ipynb)) [here](/tutorials/cookbooks/capture-user-feedback).

    frameBorder="0"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
    allowFullScreen
  ></iframe>
</div>


We released tool usage in the Agenta playground - a key feature for anyone building agents with LLMs.

Agents need tools to access external data, perform calculations, or call APIs. 

Now you can:
- Define tools directly in the playground using JSON schema
- Test how your prompt generates tool calls in real-time
- Preview how your agent handles tool responses
- Verify tool call correctness with custom evaluators

The tool schema is saved with your prompt configuration, making integration easy when you fetch configs through the API.

    allowFullScreen
  ></iframe>
</div>


We now support structured output support in the playground. You can define the expected output format and validate the output against it.

With Agenta's playground, implementing structured outputs is straightforward:

- Open any prompt

- Switch the Response format dropdown from text to JSON mode or JSON Schema

- Paste or write your schema (Agenta supports the full JSON Schema specification)

- Run the prompt - the response panel will show the response beautified

- Commit the changes - the schema will be saved with your prompt, so when your SDK fetches the prompt, it will include the schema information

Check out the blog post for more detail https://agenta.ai/blog/structured-outputs-playground

**Key capabilities:**
- View all variants and revisions in a single table
- Access all commits made to a variant
- Use older versions of variants directly in the playground

Learn more in our [blog post](https://agenta.ai/blog/introducing-prompt-registry).

**Bug Fixes**
- Fixed minor UI issues with dots in sidebar menu 
- Fixed minor playground UI issues
- Fixed playground reset default model name
- Fixed project_id issue on testset detail page
- Fixed breaking issues with old variants encountered during QA
- Fixed variant naming logic

### [Improvements to the Playground and Custom Workflows](/changelog/improvements-to-the-playground-and-custom-workflows)
_19 March 2025_
**v0.36.0**

We've made several improvements to the playground, including:
- Improved scrolling behavior
- Increased discoverability of variants creation and comparison
- Implemented stop functionality in the playground

As for custom workflows, now they work with sub-routes. This means you can have multiple routes in one file and create multiple custom workflows from the same file.

---

### [OpenTelemetry Compliance and Custom workflows from API](/changelog/opentelemetry-compliance-and-custom-workflows-from-api)

_11 March 2025_

**v0.35.0**

We've introduced major improvements to Agenta, focusing on OpenTelemetry compliance and simplified custom workflow debugging.

**OpenTelemetry (OTel) Support**:

Agenta is now fully OpenTelemetry-compliant. This means you can seamlessly integrate Agenta with thousands of OTel-compatible services using existing SDKs. To integrate your application with Agenta, simply configure an OTel exporter pointing to your Agenta endpoint—no additional setup required.

We've enhanced distributed tracing capabilities to better debug complex distributed agent systems. All HTTP interactions between agents—whether running within Agenta's SDK or externally—are automatically traced, making troubleshooting and monitoring easier.

Detailed instructions and examples are available in our [distributed tracing documentation](/observability/opentelemetry).

**Improved Custom Workflows**:

Based on your feedback, we've streamlined debugging and running custom workflows:

- **Run workflows from your environments**: You no longer need the Agenta CLI to manage custom workflows. Setting up custom workflows now involves simply adding the Agenta SDK to your code, creating an endpoint, and connecting it to Agenta via the web UI. You can check how it's done in the [quick start guide](/custom-workflows/overview).

- **Custom Workflows in the new playground**: Custom workflows are now fully compatible with the new playground. You can now nest configurations, run side-by-side comparisons, and debug your agents and complex workflows very easily.

**v0.33.0**

<Stream controls src="fcf2b69dacb3e3a624c09af40c2dc154" height="400px" />
<br />

We've rebuilt our playground from scratch to make prompt engineering faster and more intuitive. The old playground took 20 seconds to create a prompt - now it's instant.

Key improvements:

- Create prompts with multiple messages using our new template system
- Format variables easily with curly bracket syntax and a built-in validator
- Switch between chat and completion prompts in one interface
- Load test sets directly in the playground to iterate faster
- Save successful outputs as test cases with one click
- Compare different prompts side-by-side
- Deploy changes straight to production

For developers, now you create prompts programmatically through our API.

You can explore these features in our updated playground documentation.

### [Viewing Traces in the Playground and Authentication for Deployed Applications](/changelog/viewing-traces-in-the-playground-and-authentication-for-deployed-applications)

_29 November 2024_

**v0.28.0**

#### Viewing traces in the playground:

You can now see traces directly in the playground. For simple applications, this means you can view the prompts sent to LLMs. For custom workflows, you get an overview of intermediate steps and outputs. This makes it easier to understand what’s happening under the hood and debug your applications.

#### Authentication improvements:

We’ve strengthened authentication for deployed applications. As you know, Agenta lets you either fetch the app’s config or call it with Agenta acting as a proxy. Now, we’ve added authentication to the second method. The APIs we create are now protected and can be called using an API key. You can find code snippets for calling the application in the overview page.

#### Documentation improvements:

We’ve added new cookbooks and updated existing documentation:

- New [cookbook for observability with LangChain](/tutorials/cookbooks/observability_langchain)
- New [cookbook for custom workflows](/tutorials/cookbooks/AI-powered-code-reviews) where we build an AI powered code reviewer
- Updated the [custom workflows documentation](/custom-workflows/overview) and added [reference](/reference/sdk/custom-workflow)
- Updated the [reference for the observability SDK](/reference/sdk/observability) and [for the prompt management SDK](/reference/sdk/configuration-management)

#### Bug fixes:

- Fixed an issue with the observability SDK not being compatible with LiteLLM.
- Fixed an issue where cost and token usage were not correctly computed for all calls.

### [Observability and Prompt Management](/changelog/observability-and-prompt-management)

_6 November 2024_

**v0.27.0**

<Image
  style={{
    display: "block",
    margin: "20px auto",
    textAlign: "center",
  }}
  img={require("/images/observability/observability.png")}
  alt="Observability view showing an open trace for an OpenAI application"
  loading="lazy"
/>
This release is one of our biggest yet—one changelog hardly does it justice.

**First up: Observability**

We’ve had observability in beta for a while, but now it’s been completely rewritten,
with a brand-new UI and fully **open-source code**.

The new [Observability SDK](/observability/overview) is compatible with [OpenTelemetry (Otel)](https://opentelemetry.io/) and [gen-ai semantic conventions](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/gen-ai/). This means you get a lot of integrations right out of the box, like [LangChain](/observability/integrations/langchain), [OpenAI](/observability/integrations/openai), and more.

We’ll publish a full blog post soon, but here’s a quick look at what the new observability offers:

- A redesigned UI that lets you visualize nested traces, making it easier to understand what’s happening behind the scenes.

- The web UI lets you filter traces by name, cost, and other attributes—you can even search through them easily.

- The SDK is Otel-compatible, and we’ve already tested integrations for [OpenAI](/observability/integrations/openai), [LangChain](/observability/integrations/langchain), [LiteLLM](/observability/integrations/litellm), and [Instructor](/observability/integrations/instructor), with guides available for each. In most cases, adding a few lines of code will have you seeing traces directly in Agenta.

**Next: Prompt Management**

We’ve completely rewritten the [prompt management SDK](/prompt-engineering/overview), giving you full CRUD capabilities for prompts and configurations. This includes creating, updating, reading history, deploying new versions, and deleting old ones. You can find a first tutorial for this [here](/tutorials/sdk/manage-prompts-with-SDK).

**And finally: LLM-as-a-Judge Overhaul**

We’ve made significant upgrades to the [LLM-as-a-Judge evaluator](/evaluation/evaluators/llm-as-a-judge). It now supports prompts with multiple messages and has access to all variables in a test case. You can also switch models (currently supporting OpenAI and Anthropic). These changes make the evaluator much more flexible, and we’re seeing better results with it.

### [New Application Management View and Various Improvements](/changelog/new-application-management-view-and-various-improvements)

_22 October 2024_

**v0.26.0**

We updated the **Application Management View** to improve the UI. Many users struggled to find their applications when they had a large number, so we've improved the view and added a search bar for quick filtering.
Additionally, we are moving towards a new project structure for the application. We moved test sets and evaluators outside of the application scope. So now, you can use the same test set and evaluators in multiple applications.

**Bug Fixes**

- Added an export button in the evaluation view to export results from the main view.
- Eliminated Pydantic warnings in the CLI.
- Improved error messages when `fetch_config` is called with wrong arguments.
- Enhanced the custom code evaluation sandbox and removed the limitation that results need to be between 0 and 1

### [Evaluator Testing Playground and a New Evaluation View](/changelog/evaluator-testing-playground-and-a-new-evaluation-view)

_22 September 2024_

**v0.25.0**

<Stream controls src="41941e8e6b5a119faa5ced10af891f86" height="400px" />
<br />
Many users faced challenges configuring evaluators in the web UI. Some
evaluators, such as `LLM as a judge`, `custom code`, or RAG evaluators can be
tricky to set up correctly on the first try. Until now, users needed to setup,
run an evaluation, check the errors, then do it again.

To address this, we've introduced a new evaluator test/debug playground. This feature allows you to test the evaluator live on real data, helping you test the configuration before committing to it and using it for evaluations.

Additionally, we have improved and redesigned the evaluation view. Both automatic and human evaluations are now within the same view but in different tabs. We're moving towards unifying all evaluator results and consolidating them in one view, allowing you to quickly get an overview of what's working.

  />
</div>

We've completely redesigned the platform's UI. Additionally we have introduced a new overview view for your applications. This is part of a series of upcoming improvements slated for the next few weeks.

The new overview view offers:

- A dashboard displaying key metrics of your application
- A table with all the variants of your applications
- A summary of your application's most recent evaluations

We've also added a new **JSON Diff evaluator**. This evaluator compares two JSON objects and provides a similarity score.

Lastly, we've updated the UI of our documentation.

### [New Alpha Version of the SDK for Creating Custom Applications](/changelog/new-alpha-version-of-the-sdk-for-creating-custom-applications)

_20 August 2024_

**v0.23.0**

We've released a new version of the SDK for creating custom applications. This Pydantic-based SDK significantly simplifies the process of building custom applications. It's fully backward compatible, so your existing code will continue to work seamlessly. We'll soon be rolling out comprehensive documentation and examples for the new SDK.

In the meantime, here's a quick example of how to use it:

```python
import agenta as ag
from agenta import Agenta
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

#highlight-start
ag.init()
#highlight-end

# Define the configuration of the application (that will be shown in the playground )
#highlight-start
class MyConfig(BaseModel):
    temperature: float = Field(default=0.2)
    prompt_template: str = Field(default="What is the capital of {country}?")
#highlight-end

# Creates an endpoint for the entrypoint of the application
#highlight-start
@ag.route("/", config_schema=MyConfig)
#highlight-end
def generate(country: str) -> str:
    # Fetch the config from the request
    #highlight-start
    config: MyConfig = ag.ConfigManager.get_from_route(schema=MyConfig)
    #highlight-end
    prompt = config.prompt_template.format(country=country)
    chat_completion = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
        temperature=config.temperature,
    )
    return chat_completion.choices[0].message.content

```

### [RAGAS Evaluators and Traces in the Playground](/changelog/ragas-evaluators-and-traces-in-the-playground)

_12 August 2024_

**v0.22.0**

We're excited to announce two major features this week:

1. We've integrated [RAGAS evaluators](https://docs.ragas.io/) into agenta. Two new evaluators have been added: **RAG Faithfulness** (measuring how consistent the LLM output is with the context) and **Context Relevancy** (assessing how relevant the retrieved context is to the question). Both evaluators use intermediate outputs within the trace to calculate the final score.

   [Check out the tutorial](/evaluation/evaluators/rag-evaluators) to learn how to use RAG evaluators.

{" "}

<div>
  <Image
    img={require("/images/changelog/rag_faithfulness.png")}
    alt="Button for exporting evaluation results"
    style={{
      display: "block",
      margin: "20px auto",
      textAlign: "center",
    }}
  />
</div>

2. You can now **view traces directly in the playground**. This feature enables you to debug your application while configuring it—for example, by examining the prompts sent to the LLM or reviewing intermediate outputs.

   <div>
     <Image
       img={require("/images/changelog/trace_in_playground.png")}
       alt="Button for exporting evaluation results"
    style={{
      display: "block",
      margin: "20px auto",
      textAlign: "center",
    }}
     />
   </div>

:::note
Both features are available exclusively in the cloud and enterprise versions of agenta.

### [Migration from MongoDB to Postgres](/changelog/migration-from-mongodb-to-postgres)

_9 July 2024_

**v0.19.0**

We have migrated the Agenta database from MongoDB to Postgres. As a result, the **platform is much more faster** (up to 10x in some use cases).

However, if you are self-hosting agenta, note that this is a breaking change that requires you to manually migrate your data from MongoDB to Postgres.

If you are using the cloud version of Agenta, there is nothing you need to do (other than enjoying the new performance improvements).

---

### [More Reliable Evaluations](/changelog/more-reliable-evaluations)

_5 July 2024_

**v0.18.0**

<div>
  <Image
    img={require("/images/changelog/export_evaluation.png")}
    alt="Button for exporting evaluation results"
    style={{
      display: "block",
      margin: "20px auto",
      textAlign: "center",
    }}
  />
</div>

We have worked extensively on improving the **reliability of evaluations**. Specifically:

- We improved the status for evaluations and added a new `Queued` status
- We improved the error handling in evaluations. Now we show the exact error message that caused the evaluation to fail.
- We fixed issues that caused evaluations to run infinitely
- We fixed issues in the calculation of scores in human evaluations.
- We fixed small UI issues with large output in human evaluations.
- We have added a new export button in the evaluation view to export the results as a CSV file.

Additionally, we have added a new [Cookbook for run evaluation using the SDK](/tutorials/sdk/evaluate-with-SDK).

In **observability**:

- We have added a **new integration with [Litellm](https://litellm.ai/)** to automatically trace all LLM calls done through it.
- Now we automatically propagate cost and token usage from spans to traces.

### [Evaluators can access all columns](/changelog/evaluators-can-access-all-columns)

_4 June 2024_

**v0.17.0**

<div>
  <Image
    img={require("/images/changelog/configure_expected_answer.png")}
    alt="Configure Expected Answer"
    style={{
      display: "block",
      margin: "20px auto",
      textAlign: "center",
    }}
  />
</div>

Evaluators now can access all columns in the test set. Previously, you were limited to using only the `correct_answer` column for the ground truth / reference answer in evaluation.
Now you can configure your evaluator to use any column in the test set as the ground truth. To do that, open the collapsable `Advanced Settings` when configuring the evaluator, and define the `Expected Answer Column` to the name of the columns containing the reference answer you want to use.

In addition to this:

- We've upgraded the SDK to pydantic v2.
- We have improved by 10x the speed for the get config endpoint
- We have add documentation for observability

### [Playground Improvements](/changelog/playground-improvements)

_24 May 2024_

**v0.14.1-13**

- We've improved the workflow for adding outputs to a dataset in the playground. In the past, you had to select the name of the test set each time. Now, the last used test set is selected by default..
  <Image
    img={require("/images/changelog/default-selected-testset_video.gif")}
    style={{
      display: "block",
      margin: "20px auto",
      textAlign: "center",
    }}
  />
- We have significantly improved the debugging experience when creating applications from code. Now, if an application fails, you can view the logs to understand the reason behind the failure.
- We moved the copy message button in the playground to the output text area.
- We now hide the cost and usage in the playground when they aren't specified
- We've made improvements to error messages in the playground

**Bug Fixes**

- Fixed the order of the arguments when running a custom code evaluator
- Fixed the timestamp in the Testset view (previous stamps was droppping the trailing 0)
- Fixed the creation of application from code in the self-hosted version when using Windows

---

### [Prompt and Configuration Registry](/changelog/prompt-and-configuration-registry)

_1 May 2024_

**v0.14.0**

We've introduced a feature that allows you to use Agenta as a prompt registry or management system. In the deployment view, we now provide an endpoint to directly fetch the latest version of your prompt. Here is how it looks like:

```

from agenta import Agenta
agenta = Agenta()
config = agenta.get_config(base_id="xxxxx", environment="production", cache_timeout=200) # Fetches the configuration with caching

```

You can find additional documentation [here](/prompt-engineering/prompt-management/how-to-integrate-with-agenta).

**Improvements**

- Previously, publishing a variant from the playground to an environment was a manual process., from now on we are publishing by default to the production environment.

### [Observability (beta)](/changelog/observability-beta)

_14th April 2024_

**v0.13.0**

You can now monitor your application usage in production. We've added a new observability feature (currently in beta), which allows you to:

- Monitor cost, latency, and the number of calls to your applications in real-time.
- View the logs of your LLM calls, including inputs, outputs, and used configurations. You can also add any interesting logs to your test set.
- Trace your more complex LLM applications to understand the logic within and debug it.

As of now, all new applications created will include observability by default. We are working towards a GA version in the next weeks, which will be scalable and better integrated with your applications. We will also be adding tutorials and documentation about it.
