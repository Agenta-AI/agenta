One of the major feature requests we had was the ability to capture user feedback and annotations (e.g. scores) to LLM responses traced in Agenta. 

Today we're previewing one of a family of features around this topic. 

As of today you can use the annotation API to add annotations to LLM responses traced in Agenta. 

This is useful to:
- Collect user feedback on LLM responses
- Run custom evaluation workflows
- Measure application performance in real-time

Check out the how to [annotate traces from API](/evaluation/annotate-api) for more details. Or try our new tutorial (available as [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/Agenta-AI/agenta/blob/main/examples/jupyter/capture_user_feedback.ipynb)) [here](/tutorials/cookbooks/capture-user-feedback).

Other stuff: 
- We have cut our migration process to take a couple of minutes instead of an hour.
