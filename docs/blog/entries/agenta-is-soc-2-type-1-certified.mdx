We've achieved SOC 2 Type 1 certification, validating our security controls for protecting sensitive LLM development data. This certification covers our entire platform, including prompt management, evaluation frameworks, and observability tools.

Key security features and improvements:

- Data encryption in transit and at rest
- Enhanced access control and authentication
- Comprehensive security monitoring
- Regular third-party security assessments
- Backup and disaster recovery protocols

This certification represents a significant milestone for teams using Agenta in production environments. Whether you're using our open-source platform or cloud offering, you can now build LLM applications with enterprise-grade security confidence.

We've also updated our [trust center](https://trustcenter.agenta.ai) with detailed information about our security practices and compliance standards. For teams interested in learning more about our security controls or requesting our SOC 2 report, please contact [team@agenta.ai](mailto:team@agenta.ai).
