We've made lots of improvements to the playground. Here are some of the highlights:

## JSON Editor Improvements

**Enhanced Error Display and Editing**

The JSON editor now provides clearer error messages and improved editing functionality. We've fixed issues with error display that previously made it difficult to debug JSON configuration problems.

**Undo Support with Ctrl+Z**

You can now use Ctrl+Z (or Cmd+Z on Mac) to undo changes in the JSON editor, making it much easier to iterate on complex JSON configurations without fear of losing your work.

**Bug Fix: JSON Field Order Preservation**

The structured output JSON field order is now preserved throughout the system. This is crucial when working with LLMs that are sensitive to the ordering of JSON fields in their responses.

Previously, JSON objects might have their field order changed during processing, which could affect LLM behavior and evaluation consistency. Now, the exact order you define is maintained across all operations.

## Playground Improvements

**Dynamic variables**

We've improved the editor behavior with dynamic variables in the prompt.

**Markdown and Text View Toggle**

You can now switch between markdown and text view for messages. 

**Collapsible Interface Elements**

We've added the ability to collapse various sections of the playground interface, helping you focus on what matters most for your current task. 

**Collapsible Test Cases for Large Sets**

When loading large test sets, you can now collapse individual test cases to better manage the interface. 

**Visual diff when committing changes**

The playground now shows a visual diff when you're committing changes, making it easy to review exactly what modifications you're about to save.
