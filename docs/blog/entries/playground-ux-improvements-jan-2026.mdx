## Overview

This release brings three quality-of-life improvements to the Playground that make testing and iterating on prompts faster and more convenient.

## What's New

### Provider Cost Display

You can now see the cost per million tokens directly in the provider selection dropdown. This helps you make informed decisions about which model to use based on both capability and cost. No more switching to external pricing pages to compare costs.

### Run Evaluations from the Playground

You can now trigger evaluations directly from the Playground without navigating to the evaluation menu. When you're testing a prompt and want to run a full evaluation, click the evaluate button to start an evaluation run with your current configuration. This keeps you in flow when iterating on prompts.

### Collapsible Test Cases

Test cases in the Playground can now be collapsed. This is especially useful when working with large test sets or test cases with long inputs and outputs. Collapse completed test cases to focus on what you're working on. You can still see a preview of each test case to maintain context while navigating through your data.


## Getting Started

These features are available now in the Playground. Start using them today:

- Open the Playground and check the provider dropdown to see costs
- Click the evaluate button to run evaluations directly
- Use the collapse controls on test cases to manage your view
