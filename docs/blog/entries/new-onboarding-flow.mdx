We've redesigned our platform's onboarding to make getting started simpler and more intuitive. Key improvements include:

- Streamlined tracing setup process
- Added a demo RAG playground project showcasing custom workflows
- Enhanced frontend performance
- Fixed scroll behavior in trace view

You can check out the tutorial for the RAG demo project [here](/tutorials/cookbooks/RAG-QA-docs).
