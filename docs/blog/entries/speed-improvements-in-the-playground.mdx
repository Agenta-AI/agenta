We rewrote most of Agenta's frontend. You'll see much faster speeds when you create prompts or use the playground.

We also made many improvements and fixed bugs:
  - [LLM-as-a-judge](/evaluation/configure-evaluators/llm-as-a-judge) now uses double curly braces `{{}}` instead of single curly braces `{` and `}`. This matches how normal prompts work. Old LLM-as-a-judge prompts with single curly braces still work. We updated the LLM-as-a-judge playground to make editing prompts easier.
  - You can now use [an external Redis instance](/self-host/configuration#redis-caching) for caching by setting it as an environment variable
  - Fixed the [custom workflow quick start tutorial](/custom-workflows/quick-start) and examples
  - Fixed SDK compatibility issues with Python 3.9
  - Fixed default filtering in observability dashboard
  - Fixed error handling in the evaluator playground
  - Fixed the Tracing SDK to allow instrumenting streaming responses and overriding OTEL environment variables
