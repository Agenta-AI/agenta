You can now create projects within an organization. This feature helps you organize your work when you're building multiple AI products or managing different teams working on separate initiatives.

## What Are Projects?

Projects provide a way to isolate and organize your AI work within an organization. Each project maintains its own scope for:

- **Prompts**: All prompt templates and variants stay within the project
- **Traces**: Observability data is scoped to the project that generated it
- **Evaluations**: Test sets, evaluators, and evaluation results belong to specific projects

This scoping prevents clutter and makes it easy to focus on one product at a time.

## Creating and Managing Projects

You can create a new project directly from the sidebar in the Agenta interface. Once created, you can switch between projects using the sidebar navigation.

Each team member can work in different projects simultaneously. The interface remembers your last active project, making it easy to pick up where you left off.

## When to Use Projects

Projects work well when you need to:

- Build multiple AI products for different use cases
- Separate development work for different teams or departments
- Keep client work isolated from internal tools

## Next Steps

If you're managing complex AI initiatives across multiple products, projects give you the structure to keep everything organized. You can create your first project from the sidebar and start organizing your prompts and evaluations.
