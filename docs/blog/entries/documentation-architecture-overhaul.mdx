We've completely rewritten and restructured our documentation with a new architecture. This is one of the largest updates we've made to the documentation, involving a near-complete rewrite of existing content and adding substantial new material.

### Diataxis Framework Implementation

We've reorganized all documentation using the [Diataxis framework](https://diataxis.fr/).

### Expanded Observability Documentation

One of the biggest gaps in our previous documentation was observability. We've added comprehensive documentation covering:

- [Tracing with OpenTelemetry](/observability/trace-with-opentelemetry/getting-started)
- [Tracing LLM applications with JS/TS](/observability/quick-start-opentelemetry)
- [Using the Metrics API to fetch metrics](/observability/query-data/analytics-data)
- [Using the Query API to fetch traces](/observability/query-data/query-api)

### JavaScript/TypeScript Support

Documentation now includes JavaScript and TypeScript examples alongside Python wherever applicable. This makes it easier for JavaScript developers to integrate Agenta into their applications.

### Ask AI Feature

We've added a new "Ask AI" feature that lets you ask questions directly to the documentation. Get instant answers to your questions without searching through pages.
