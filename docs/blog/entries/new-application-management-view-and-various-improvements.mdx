We updated the **Application Management View** to improve the UI. Many users struggled to find their applications when they had a large number, so we've improved the view and added a search bar for quick filtering.
Additionally, we are moving towards a new project structure for the application. We moved test sets and evaluators outside of the application scope. So now, you can use the same test set and evaluators in multiple applications.

**Bug Fixes**

- Added an export button in the evaluation view to export results from the main view.
- Eliminated Pydantic warnings in the CLI.
- Improved error messages when `fetch_config` is called with wrong arguments.
- Enhanced the custom code evaluation sandbox and removed the limitation that results need to be between 0 and 1
