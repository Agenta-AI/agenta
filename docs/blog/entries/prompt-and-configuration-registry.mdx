We've introduced a feature that allows you to use Agenta as a prompt registry or management system. In the deployment view, we now provide an endpoint to directly fetch the latest version of your prompt. Here is how it looks like:

```

from agenta import Agenta
agenta = Agenta()
config = agenta.get_config(base_id="xxxxx", environment="production", cache_timeout=200) # Fetches the configuration with caching

```

You can find additional documentation [here](/prompt-engineering/integrating-prompts/integrating-with-agenta).

**Improvements**

- Previously, publishing a variant from the playground to an environment was a manual process., from now on we are publishing by default to the production environment.
