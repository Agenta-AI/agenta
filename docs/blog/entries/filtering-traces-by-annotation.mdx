We rebuilt the filtering system in observability. We added a new dropdown with more options. Additionally, we added a new annotation filtering. You can now filter and search traces based on their annotations. This feature helps you find traces with low scores or bad feedback quickly.

### New Filter Options

The new dropdown is simpler and gives you more options. You can now filter by:
- **Span status**: Find successful or failed spans
- **Input keys**: Search for specific inputs in your spans
- **App or environment**: Filter traces from specific apps or environments
- **Any key within your span**: Search custom data in your trace structure

### Annotation Filtering

Filter traces based on evaluations and feedback:
- **Evaluator results**: Find spans evaluated by a specific evaluator
- **User feedback**: Search for spans with feedback like `success=True`

This feature enables powerful workflows:

1. **Capture user feedback** from your application using our API ([see tutorial](/tutorials/cookbooks/capture-user-feedback))
2. **Filter traces** to find those with bad feedback or low scores
3. **Add them to test sets** to track problematic cases
4. **Improve your prompts** based on real user feedback

The filtering system makes it easy to turn production issues into test cases.
