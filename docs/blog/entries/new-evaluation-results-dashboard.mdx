We rebuilt the evaluation results dashboard. Now you can check your results faster and see how well your AI performs.

## What's New

### **Charts and Graphs**
We added charts that show your AI's performance. You can quickly spot problems and see patterns in your data.

### **Compare Results Side by Side**
Compare multiple tests at once. See which prompts or models work better. View charts and detailed results together.

### **Better Results Table**
Results now show in a clean table format. It works great for small tests (10 cases) and big tests (10,000+ cases). The page loads fast no matter how much data you have.

### **Detailed View**
Click on any result to see more details. Find out why a test passed or failed. Get the full picture of what happened.

### **See Your Settings**
Check exactly which settings you used for each test. This helps you repeat successful tests and understand your results better.

### **Name Your Tests**
Give your tests names and descriptions. Stay organized and help your team understand what each test does.
