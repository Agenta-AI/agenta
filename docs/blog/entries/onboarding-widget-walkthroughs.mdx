# Onboarding Widget and Guided Walkthroughs

## Overview

Getting started with a new platform can be overwhelming. You now have an onboarding widget that guides you through Agenta's key features step by step. The widget appears in the sidebar and tracks your progress as you explore the platform.

Each walkthrough highlights the relevant UI elements and explains what they do. You learn by doing, not by reading documentation.

## Key Capabilities

- **Progress Tracking**: The widget shows which features you've explored and what's left to discover
- **Interactive Walkthroughs**: Step-by-step tours that highlight UI elements as you go
- **Contextual Guidance**: Each walkthrough focuses on a specific workflow, from creating prompts to running evaluations
- **Dismissible**: Once you're comfortable, dismiss the widget and it stays out of your way

## Available Walkthroughs

The onboarding widget includes guided tours for:

- **Playground Basics**: Create and test prompts, compare variants, and iterate on your configurations
- **Running Evaluations**: Set up test sets, configure evaluators, and analyze results
- **Observability**: Trace your LLM calls, add annotations, and debug production issues
- **Deployment**: Deploy prompts to environments and fetch configurations in your code

## How It Works

The onboarding widget appears automatically for new users. Each walkthrough takes you through the actual UI, highlighting buttons, menus, and features as you go. Complete a walkthrough to mark it done, or skip ahead if you already know the basics.

You can reopen the widget anytime from the sidebar to revisit walkthroughs or check your progress.

## Getting Started

The widget appears automatically when you sign up or create a new project. If you've dismissed it and want it back, look for the help icon in the sidebar.
