We've made significant improvements across Agenta with a major documentation overhaul, new model support, self-hosting enhancements, and UI improvements.

**Revamped Prompt Engineering Documentation**:

We've completely rewritten our prompt management and prompt engineering documentation.

Start exploring the new documentation in our updated [Quick Start Guide](/prompt-engineering/quick-start).

**New Model Support**:

Our platform now supports several new LLM models:

- Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro and Flash
- Alibaba Cloud's Qwen 3
- OpenAI's GPT-4.1

These models are available in both the playground and through the API.

**Playground Enhancements**:

We've added a draft state to the playground, providing a better editing experience. Changes are now clearly marked as drafts until committed.

**Self-Hosting Improvements**:

We've significantly simplified the self-hosting experience by changing how environment variables are handled in the frontend:

- No more rebuilding images to change ports or domains
- Dynamic configuration through environment variables at runtime

Check out our updated [self-hosting documentation](/self-host/quick-start) for details.

**Bug Fixes and Optimizations**:

- Fixed OpenTelemetry integration edge cases
- Resolved edge cases in the API that affected certain workflow configurations
- Improved UI responsiveness and fixed minor visual inconsistencies
- Added chat support in cloud
