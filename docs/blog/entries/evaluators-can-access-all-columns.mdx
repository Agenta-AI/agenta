Evaluators now can access all columns in the test set. Previously, you were limited to using only the `correct_answer` column for the ground truth / reference answer in evaluation.
Now you can configure your evaluator to use any column in the test set as the ground truth. To do that, open the collapsable `Advanced Settings` when configuring the evaluator, and define the `Expected Answer Column` to the name of the columns containing the reference answer you want to use.

In addition to this:

- We've upgraded the SDK to pydantic v2.
- We have improved by 10x the speed for the get config endpoint
- We have add documentation for observability
