We've rebuilt our playground from scratch to make prompt engineering faster and more intuitive. The old playground took 20 seconds to create a prompt - now it's instant.

Key improvements:

- Create prompts with multiple messages using our new template system
- Format variables easily with curly bracket syntax and a built-in validator
- Switch between chat and completion prompts in one interface
- Load test sets directly in the playground to iterate faster
- Save successful outputs as test cases with one click
- Compare different prompts side-by-side
- Deploy changes straight to production

For developers, now you create prompts programmatically through our API.

You can explore these features in our updated playground documentation.
