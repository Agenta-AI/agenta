We now support structured output support in the playground. You can define the expected output format and validate the output against it.

With Agenta's playground, implementing structured outputs is straightforward:

- Open any prompt

- Switch the Response format dropdown from text to JSON mode or JSON Schema

- Paste or write your schema (Agenta supports the full JSON Schema specification)

- Run the prompt - the response panel will show the response beautified

- Commit the changes - the schema will be saved with your prompt, so when your SDK fetches the prompt, it will include the schema information
