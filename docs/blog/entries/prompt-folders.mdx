## The Problem

When you're building agents or managing multiple use cases, prompts multiply fast. Finding the right one turns into scrolling through a flat list.

## The Solution

You can now create folders and subfolders to organize your prompts. It works like any file system you've used before.

Create a folder. Drag prompts into it. Create subfolders. Move things around as your structure evolves.

<div style={{display: "flex", justifyContent: "center", marginTop: "20px", marginBottom: "20px", flexDirection: "column", alignItems: "center"}}>
  <iframe
    width="100%"
    height="500"
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2oy6ymnOq7I"
    title="Folders for Prompt Organization"
    frameBorder="0"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
    allowFullScreen
  ></iframe>
</div>

## What You Can Do

- **Create folders** and nest them as deep as you need
- **Move prompts and folders** via drag-and-drop or the actions menu
- **Search** across all folders from the root level
- **Share folder URLs** with teammates (folder location persists in the URL)

## Getting Started

Go to the Prompts page. Click "Create new" and select "New folder". Name it, and start organizing.
