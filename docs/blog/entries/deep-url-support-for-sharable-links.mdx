URLs across Agenta now include workspace context, making them fully shareable between team members. This was a highly requested feature that addresses several critical issues with the previous URL structure.

## What Changed

### Before
- URLs did not include workspace information
- Sharing links between team members would redirect to the recipient's default workspace
- Page refreshes would sometimes lose context and revert to the default workspace
- Deep linking to specific resources was unreliable

### Now
- All URLs include the workspace context in the URL path
- Links shared between team members work correctly, maintaining the intended workspace
- Page refreshes maintain the correct workspace context
- Deep linking works reliably for all resources

## What You Can Deep Link

You can now create shareable deep links to almost any resource in Agenta:

- **Prompts**: Share direct links to specific prompts in any workspace
- **Evaluations**: Link directly to evaluation results and configurations
- **Test Sets**: Share test sets with team members
- **Playground Sessions**: Link to specific playground configurations
