We have migrated the Agenta database from MongoDB to Postgres. As a result, the **platform is much more faster** (up to 10x in some use cases).

However, if you are self-hosting agenta, note that this is a breaking change that requires you to manually migrate your data from MongoDB to Postgres.

If you are using the cloud version of Agenta, there is nothing you need to do (other than enjoying the new performance improvements).
