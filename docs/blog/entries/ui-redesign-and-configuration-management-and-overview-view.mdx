We've completely redesigned the platform's UI. Additionally we have introduced a new overview view for your applications. This is part of a series of upcoming improvements slated for the next few weeks.

The new overview view offers:

- A dashboard displaying key metrics of your application
- A table with all the variants of your applications
- A summary of your application's most recent evaluations

We've also added a new **JSON Diff evaluator**. This evaluator compares two JSON objects and provides a similarity score.

Lastly, we've updated the UI of our documentation.
