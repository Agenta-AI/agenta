We're open sourcing the core of Agenta under the MIT license. All functional features are now available to the community.

## What's Open Source

Every feature you need to build, test, and deploy LLM applications is now open source. This includes the evaluation system, prompt playground and management, observability, and all core workflows.

You can run evaluations using LLM-as-a-Judge, custom code evaluators, or any built-in evaluator. Create and manage test sets. Evaluate end-to-end workflows or specific spans in traces.

Experiment with prompts in the playground. Version and commit changes. Deploy to environments. Fetch configurations programmatically.

Trace your LLM applications with OpenTelemetry support. View detailed execution traces. Monitor costs and performance. Filter and search traces.

## Building in Public Again

We've moved development back to the public repository. You can see what we're building, contribute features, and shape the product direction.

## What Remains Under Commercial License

Only enterprise collaboration features stay under a separate license. This includes role-based access control (RBAC), single sign-on (SSO), and audit logs. These features support teams with specific compliance and security requirements.

## Get Started

Follow the [self-hosting quick start guide](/self-host/quick-start) to deploy Agenta on your infrastructure. View the source code and contribute on [GitHub](https://github.com/Agenta-AI/agenta). Read why we made this decision at [agenta.ai/blog/commercial-open-source-is-hard-our-journey](https://agenta.ai/blog/commercial-open-source-is-hard-our-journey).

## What This Means for You

You can run Agenta on your infrastructure with full access to evaluation, prompting, and observability features. You can modify the code to fit your needs. You can contribute back to the project.

The MIT license gives you freedom to use, modify, and distribute Agenta. We believe open source creates better products through community collaboration.
