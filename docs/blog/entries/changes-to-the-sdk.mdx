This necessitated modifications to the SDK. Now, the LLM application API returns a JSON instead of a string. The JSON includes the output message, usage details, and cost:

```

{
"message": string,
"usage": {
"prompt_tokens": int,
"completion_tokens": int,
"total_tokens": int
},
"cost": float
}

```
