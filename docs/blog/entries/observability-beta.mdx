You can now monitor your application usage in production. We've added a new observability feature (currently in beta), which allows you to:

- Monitor cost, latency, and the number of calls to your applications in real-time.
- View the logs of your LLM calls, including inputs, outputs, and used configurations. You can also add any interesting logs to your test set.
- Trace your more complex LLM applications to understand the logic within and debug it.

As of now, all new applications created will include observability by default. We are working towards a GA version in the next weeks, which will be scalable and better integrated with your applications. We will also be adding tutorials and documentation about it.
