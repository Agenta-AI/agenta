We released tool usage in the Agenta playground - a key feature for anyone building agents with LLMs.

Agents need tools to access external data, perform calculations, or call APIs. 

Now you can:
- Define tools directly in the playground using JSON schema
- Test how your prompt generates tool calls in real-time
- Preview how your agent handles tool responses
- Verify tool call correctness with custom evaluators

The tool schema is saved with your prompt configuration, making integration easy when you fetch configs through the API.
