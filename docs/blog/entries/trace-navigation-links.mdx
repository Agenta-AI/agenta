# Navigation Links from Traces to App/Environment/Variant

## Overview

You can now click directly from any trace to the application, variant, version, or environment that generated it. This makes debugging much faster. Instead of manually searching for which configuration produced a specific output, you can jump there in one click.

This is especially useful when you're investigating production issues. You see a problematic trace, click through to the exact prompt version, and start iterating immediately.

## Key Capabilities

- **Clickable Application Links**: Jump from a trace to the application that generated it
- **Variant Navigation**: Go directly to the specific variant and version used
- **Environment Context**: See and navigate to the environment (production, staging, development) where the trace originated
- **Drawer Integration**: Links appear in both the trace table and the detailed drawer view

## How to Add References to Your Traces

For the navigation links to appear, you need to store references in your traces. Here's how to do it with the Python SDK and OpenTelemetry.

### Using the Python SDK

```python
import agenta as ag

ag.init()

# Store references to link traces to your configuration
ag.tracing.store_refs({
    "application.slug": "my-chatbot",
    "variant.slug": "gpt-4-optimized",
    "variant.version": "3",
    "environment.slug": "production",
})

# Your LLM calls are now linked to this configuration
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
)
```

### Using OpenTelemetry

If you're using OpenTelemetry for instrumentation, add references as span attributes:

```javascript
import { trace } from '@opentelemetry/api';

const tracer = trace.getTracer('my-app');
const span = tracer.startSpan('chat-interaction');

// Add references to link the trace
span.setAttribute('ag.refs.application.slug', 'my-chatbot');
span.setAttribute('ag.refs.variant.slug', 'gpt-4-optimized');
span.setAttribute('ag.refs.variant.version', '3');
span.setAttribute('ag.refs.environment.slug', 'production');

// Your code here
span.end();
```

## Available Reference Keys

You can use any combination of these reference keys:

| Category | Keys |
|----------|------|
| Application | `application.slug`, `application.id` |
| Variant | `variant.slug`, `variant.id`, `variant.version` |
| Environment | `environment.slug`, `environment.id`, `environment.version` |

## Use Cases

### Debug Production Issues
When a user reports a problem, find the trace and click through to see exactly which prompt version was used. No more guessing or searching through commit history.

### Compare Configurations
Filter traces by variant, then click through to compare how different configurations perform. Jump between variants to understand what changed.

### Track Deployments
See which environment generated each trace. Verify that production is running the expected version by clicking through from any trace.
