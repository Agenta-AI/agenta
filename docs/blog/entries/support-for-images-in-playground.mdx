Agenta now supports images in the playground, test sets, and evaluations. This enables a systematic workflow for developing and testing applications that use vision models.

**New Features:**

- **Image Support in Playground:** Add images directly to your prompts when experimenting in the playground.
- **Multi-modal Test Sets:** Create and manage test sets that include image inputs alongside text.
- **Image-based Evaluations:** Run evaluations on prompts designed to process images, allowing for systematic comparison of different prompt versions or models.
