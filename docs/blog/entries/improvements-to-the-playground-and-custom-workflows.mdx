We've made several improvements to the playground, including:
- Improved scrolling behavior
- Increased discoverability of variants creation and comparison
- Implemented stop functionality in the playground

As for custom workflows, now they work with sub-routes. This means you can have multiple routes in one file and create multiple custom workflows from the same file.
