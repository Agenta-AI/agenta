We've added support for Google Cloud's Vertex AI platform. You can now use Gemini models and other Vertex AI partner models directly in Agenta.

### What's New

Vertex AI is now available as a provider across the platform:

- **Playground**: Configure and test Gemini models and other Vertex AI models
- **Model Hub**: Add your Vertex AI credentials and manage available models
- **Gateway**: Access Vertex AI models through the InVoke endpoints

You can use any model available through Vertex AI, including:
- **Gemini models**: Google's most capable AI models (gemini-2.5-pro, gemini-2.5-flash, etc.)
- **Partner models**: Claude, Llama, Mistral, and other models available through Vertex AI Model Garden

### Configuration

To get started with Vertex AI, go to Settings → Model Hub and add your Vertex AI credentials:

- **Vertex Project**: Your Google Cloud project ID
- **Vertex Location**: The region for your models (e.g., `us-central1`, `europe-west4`)
- **Vertex Credentials**: Your service account key in JSON format

For detailed setup instructions, see our [documentation on adding custom providers](/prompt-engineering/playground/custom-providers#configuring-vertex-ai).

### Security

All API keys and credentials are encrypted both in transit and at rest, ensuring your sensitive information stays secure.
