**v0.14.1-13**

- We've improved the workflow for adding outputs to a dataset in the playground. In the past, you had to select the name of the test set each time. Now, the last used test set is selected by default..
  <Image
    img={require("/images/changelog/default-selected-testset_video.gif")}
    style={{
      display: "block",
      margin: "20px auto",
      textAlign: "center",
    }}
  />
- We have significantly improved the debugging experience when creating applications from code. Now, if an application fails, you can view the logs to understand the reason behind the failure.
- We moved the copy message button in the playground to the output text area.
- We now hide the cost and usage in the playground when they aren't specified
- We've made improvements to error messages in the playground

**Bug Fixes**

- Fixed the order of the arguments when running a custom code evaluator
- Fixed the timestamp in the Testset view (previous stamps was droppping the trailing 0)
- Fixed the creation of application from code in the self-hosted version when using Windows
