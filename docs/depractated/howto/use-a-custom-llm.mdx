Using a custom LLM in Agenta is straightforward. The process involves writing the code for a custom application using the SDK, which then calls the LLM.

Below is the structure of a custom application that calls a  [vllm hosted model on an API server](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/getting_started/quickstart.html#api-server):

```python

import agenta as ag
import requests

default_prompt = "Please write a joke about {subject}"

url = "https://<api-server-url>/generate"
ag.config.default(prompt=default_prompt,
                  temperature=0.8)

@ag.entrypoint
def generate(subject:str)->str:
    prompt = config.prompt.format(subject=subject)
    data = {
        "prompt": prompt,
        "temperature": config.temperature
    }
    response = requests.post(url, data=json.dumps(data))
    return response.json()
```

The above code is a simple LLM app that generates jokes about a given subject, using a vLLM hosted model. It is structured as follows:

`ag.config.default` sets the default values for the configuration of the LLM application. In this example, the default prompt is "Please write a joke about {subject}", and the temperature is set at 0.8.

The `@ag.entrypoint` decorator marks the function that will be called. The function `generate` accepts a subject as input and returns a joke as output. It calls the vLLM hosted model using the requests library.

To call any other LLM, you need to set up the configuration for the LLM (prompt, temperature, etc.) and then call the LLM in the main function.

After writing the code, it can be deployed using the CLI, as described in the [command line reference](/cli/quick-usage). This can be done by running `agenta init` followed by `agenta variant serve app.py` in the code folder.

<Warning> Note that if the LLM is hosted on your local machine and not accessible from outside, you will need to [self-host agenta locally](self-host/host-locally) to be able to call the LLM from the LLm app. </Warning>
