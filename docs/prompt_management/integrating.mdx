## Overview

Applications and prompts created in agenta can be integrated into your projects in two primary ways:

1. **As a Prompt Management System:** Fetch the latest version of prompts/configurations from agenta.

2. **As a Middleware:** Use the applications hosted on agenta directly.

## Using agenta as Middleware

When using agenta as middleware, you directly interact with applications hosted on agenta. This method is straightforward and includes built-in observability features.

### Steps to Integrate:

- Navigate to the deployment view in agenta.
- Locate the API endpoints under the "Endpoints" menu.
- Use these endpoints in your application to interact with the hosted LLM apps.

The applications are fully instrumented, and all traces can be viewed in the observability dashboard.

## Using agenta as a Prompt Management System

You can use agenta to manage and fetch prompts or configurations.

### Step:

- Install the agenta Python SDK (`pip install agenta`).
- Set up environment variables:
  - `AGENTA_API_KEY` for cloud users.
  - `AGENTA_HOST` set to `http://localhost` if you are self-hosting.

### Example Code:

```python
from agenta import Agenta
agenta = Agenta() 
config = agenta.get_config(base_id="xxxxx", environment="production", cache_timeout=200) # Fetches the configuration with caching
````
The response object is an instance of `GetConfigResponse` from `agenta.client.backend.types.get_config_response`. It contains the following attributes:
- `config_name`: 'default'
- `current_version`: 1
- `parameters`: This dictionary contains the configuration of the application, for instance:
```
{'temperature': 1.0,
'model': 'gpt-3.5-turbo',
'max_tokens': -1,
'prompt_system': 'You are an expert in geography.',
'prompt_user': 'What is the capital of {country}?',
'top_p': 1.0,
'frequence_penalty': 0.0,
'presence_penalty': 0.0,
'force_json': 0} 
```
