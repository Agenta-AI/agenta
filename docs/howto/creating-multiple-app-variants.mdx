## How to Create Multiple App Variants in a Single Project

This guide provides instructions on creating multiple variants within one project. A "variant" is a unique version of your app that may feature a different architecture or significant changes in the codebase. (See [the concept guide](/conceptual/concepts#app-variant) for more details on variants.)

## Ways to Create App Variants

We recommend two primary workflows for creating app variants from the command line interface (CLI):

- [Git Branch Workflow](#git-branch-workflow)
- [Multiple Files Workflow](#multiple-files-workflow)

And one additional method through the web interface:

- [Playground Workflow](#playground-workflow)

## Git Branch Workflow

This approach creates a new Git branch for each variant, enabling version control for each different version of your app.

Here are the steps to follow:

1. For each variant, create a new branch with the command: `git checkout -b variant_name`
2. Modify the code in your specific file (replace the content in `app.py`)
3. Run the following command with the new code, using the same branch name: `agenta variant serve --file_name app.py`

## Multiple Files Workflow

This method involves creating a separate Python file for each variant in the same folder (e.g. `variant_1.py`, `variant_2.py`). The files can be named as you wish. Compared to the [Git Branch Workflow](#git-branch-workflow), this workflow allows to easily switch between variants without moving between branches.

To create a variant using this workflow:

1. Create a new script for the new variant, either by starting from scratch or copying and older version`cp app.py variant_name.py` and then modifying it. This file will contain the code for the new variant with `@post` for the main function.
2. Run the command `agenta variant serve --file_name=variant_name.py`
3. When naming your variants, ensure the variant name aligns with the file name (e.g., `variant_name.py` -> `variant_name`)

## Playground Workflow

Alternatively, you can create app variants directly from the Playground interface. To create a new variant, click the '+' symbol on the tabs in Playground.
