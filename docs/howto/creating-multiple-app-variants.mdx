title: Compare Different LLM App Variants
---

This guide will walk you through how to create and compare multiple variants of your LLM app.

# Creating LLM App Variants

## Why Create Multiple Variants?

To build reliable LLM apps, it's essential to test various parameters and strategies systematically. Agenta makes it easy to create and evaluate different **variants** of your LLM app.

## What Are LLM App Variants?

An LLM app variant is a unique version of your app that can differ in architecture or code changes. For more details, check [the concept guide](/conceptual/concepts#app-variant). For example, a Q&A app might have one variant using an embedding workflow and another using a map-reduce workflow.

A variant could also be a different configuration of the same app. You might have two variants that use different prompts or models.

## How to Create Multiple Variants?

You can create variants either through code or via the UI.

### Creating a New Variant Using the UI
To create a new variant from the UI, click the '+' symbol on the Playground tabs.
<Frame caption="Click on the '+' button in Playground to create new variants">
<img height="600" src="/images/add_variant_from_UI.png" />
</Frame>
Variants added through the UI can only change parameters that exist in the original variant or have been specified in your code.

<Note>The naming convention for variants created via the UI is **sourceVariantName.newVariantName**. This helps you identify which version of the code corresponds to each variant.</Note>

### Creating a New Variant Using Code

To create a variant via code, add a new Python script in your project folder (the one where you ran `agenta init`). Name the file after your new variant. For example, if your new variant is `variant_1`, create a file called `variant_1.py`. Then run the following command:

```bash
agenta variant serve --file_name variant_1.py
```

Navigate to the Playground, and you'll see your new variant `variant_1` available for comparison.

# Comparing Variants

Initially, you can compare variants by running them in the Playground to quickly test different configurations.

For more in-depth comparisons, go to the evaluation section. There, you can use various methods such as manual labeling with the A/B testing feature, or automated evaluation (documentation coming soon).
