---

Agenta is an open-source developer first LLMOps platform to streamline the process of building LLM-powered applications. Building LLM-powered apps is an iterative process with lots of prompt-engineering and testing multiple variants. Agenta brings the CI/CD platform to this process by enabling you to quickly iterate, experiment, evaluate, and optimize your LLM apps. All without imposing any restrictions on your choice of framework, library, or model.

## How Agenta works:

1. Develop your LLM-powered application as you would normally do. Feel free to use any framework, library, or model (langchain, llma_index, GPT-3, or open-source models).
2. With two lines of code, specify the parameters for your experiment.
3. Deploy your app using the Agenta CLI.
4. You or your team can iterate, version parameters, test different versions, and run systematic evaluations via a user-friendly web platform.

## Key Benefits

- **Parameter Playground:** With just a few lines of code, define the parameters you wish to experiment with. Through our user-friendly web platform, you or your team can then experiment and tweak these parameters.

- **Version Evaluation:** Define test sets, evaluate, and compare different app versions.

- **API Deployment Made Easy:** Agenta allows you to deploy your LLM applications as APIs without any additional effort. (Currently only available locally)

## Why choose Agenta for building LLM-apps?

While there are numerous LLMops platforms, we believe Agenta offers unique benefits:

- Developer-Friendly: We cater to complex LLM-apps and pipelines that require more than just a few no-code abstractions. We give you the freedom to develop your apps the way you want.
- Privacy-First: We respect your privacy and do not proxy your data through third-party services. You have the choice to host your data and models.
- Solution-Agnostic: You have the freedom to use any library and models, be it Langchain, llma_index, or a custom-written alternative.
- Collaborative: We recognize that building LLM-powered apps requires the collaboration of developers and domain experts. Our tool enables this collaboration, allowing domain experts to edit and modify parameters (e.g., prompts, hyperparameters, etc.), and label results for evaluation.
- Open-Source: We encourage you to contribute to the platform and customize it to suit your needs.
