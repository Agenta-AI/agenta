## Summary

The proposal and tasks are implemented end-to-end. All ten findings are resolved on this branch — six from the original scan, four from the PR #4325 sync pass.

Original scan findings (closed):

- F-001 — fixed a real production bug: support middleware was outside `BaseHTTPMiddleware`s, so ContextVar mutations from the handler never reached it. Headers were silently dropped on every real request.
- F-002 — added a schema assert on `Support.model_fields`.
- F-003 — stripped `support_id` / `support_ts` from `ConflictException` (409) and intercepted-5xx `detail`; headers only.
- F-004 — user is regenerating API docs separately.
- F-005 — proposal doc clarified.
- F-006 — `expose_headers=["x-ag-support-id", "x-ag-support-ts"]` added to CORS so browser JS can read them.

Sync-derived findings (closed):

- F-007 — rewrote `tasks.md` §3 `intercept_exceptions` bullet to describe headers-only behavior.
- F-008 — renumbered duplicate `## 4` in `tasks.md`; cascaded §5..§8 → §6..§9.
- F-009 — rewrote `gap.md` exceptions.py row and "Files that do not change" bullet to reflect headers-only behavior.
- F-010 — deleted the local `_SupportHeadersMiddleware` mirror in `test_exceptions.py`; tests now import the real `SupportHeadersMiddleware` from `oss.src.apis.fastapi.shared.utils`. All 7 tests pass.

## Rules

- Severity scheme: `P0` / `P1` / `P2` / `P3` (per [findings.schema.md](../../../agents/skills/shared/references/findings.schema.md)).

## Notes

- `web/packages/agenta-api-client/src/generated/api/types/*Response.ts` still list `support_id?` / `support_ts?`. These regenerate when the OpenAPI snapshot refreshes and the Fern client is rebuilt — no action required here.

## Open Findings

### [OPEN] F-015 — PR description doesn't mention the support-header wire-shape change (P2, high, needs-user-action)

- **Origin**: PR #4347 sync, 13th Copilot pass (2026-05-19T12:42Z)
- **PR comment**: [discussion_r3266334503](https://github.com/Agenta-AI/agenta/pull/4347#discussion_r3266334503) on `api/oss/src/utils/exceptions.py:180`
- **Background**: Removing `support_id` / `support_ts` from `HTTPException.detail` is a client-visible wire-shape change for intercepted 5xx and 409 responses, but PR #4347's description focuses on metering/auth changes and does not call out the support-header migration. Copilot is asking the author to add a section to the PR body so reviewers and client maintainers don't miss the response-shape change.
- **Action (user)**: Edit the PR #4347 description (`gh pr edit 4347 --body …` or the web UI) to add a short section under "Wire-shape changes" that names the three affected response shapes (suppressed-failure body, intercepted 5xx `detail`, intercepted 409 `detail`) and the corresponding headers (`x-ag-support-id`, `x-ag-support-ts`). The wire-table at `docs/designs/support-fields/proposal.md:234-239` is the source of truth.

### [CLOSED — duplicates] F-011-dup / F-012-dup — Copilot 13th pass re-flagged the same drift on the pre-fix tree

- **Origin**: PR #4347 sync, 13th Copilot pass (2026-05-19T12:42Z)
- **PR comments**: [discussion_r3266334422](https://github.com/Agenta-AI/agenta/pull/4347#discussion_r3266334422) (tasks.md:96, dup of F-011); [discussion_r3266334536](https://github.com/Agenta-AI/agenta/pull/4347#discussion_r3266334536) (proposal.md:213, dup of F-012)
- **Background**: Copilot's 13th pass ran against commit `ec12ccfa7` ("clean up findings") which predates the F-011 / F-012 doc rewrites. The underlying content is the same drift, already fixed in the working tree.
- **Action**: Both GitHub threads replied to ([discussion_r3266354583](https://github.com/Agenta-AI/agenta/pull/4347#discussion_r3266354583), [discussion_r3266354838](https://github.com/Agenta-AI/agenta/pull/4347#discussion_r3266354838)) pointing at the working-tree fix; both resolved.

## Closed Findings

### [CLOSED] F-011 — `tasks.md` §6 test bullet rewritten to describe the headers-only `intercept_exceptions` contract

- **Origin**: PR #4347 sync, 12th Copilot pass
- **PR comment**: [discussion_r3266169058](https://github.com/Agenta-AI/agenta/pull/4347#discussion_r3266169058)
- **File**: `docs/designs/support-fields/tasks.md` §6, ~L94-L97
- **Fix shipped**: Replaced the "keep [the test] as-is (the `detail` payload is unchanged)" bullet with "Rewrite `test_intercept_exceptions_includes_support_metadata` to assert `support_id` / `support_ts` are absent from `HTTPException.detail` and present via `support_ctx.get()` (the response headers carry them; the body does not)."
- **Action**: GitHub thread replied to ([discussion_r3266331024](https://github.com/Agenta-AI/agenta/pull/4347#discussion_r3266331024)) and resolved.

### [CLOSED] F-012 — `proposal.md` §6 test paragraph rewritten to describe the headers-only contract

- **Origin**: PR #4347 sync, 12th Copilot pass
- **PR comment**: [discussion_r3266169079](https://github.com/Agenta-AI/agenta/pull/4347#discussion_r3266169079)
- **File**: `docs/designs/support-fields/proposal.md` §6, ~L209-L218
- **Fix shipped**: Rewrote both test bullets to match the shipped implementation. `test_suppress_exceptions_attaches_support_to_response` now uses `support_ctx.get()` (not `request.state.support`) and asserts the payload carries no support fields. `test_intercept_exceptions_includes_support_metadata` now asserts the fields are absent from `HTTPException.detail` and present via `support_ctx.get()`.
- **Action**: GitHub thread replied to ([discussion_r3266331250](https://github.com/Agenta-AI/agenta/pull/4347#discussion_r3266331250)) and resolved.

### [CLOSED] F-013 — `proposal.md` client-impact paragraph now covers all three wire-shape changes

- **Origin**: PR #4347 sync, 12th Copilot pass
- **PR comment**: [discussion_r3266169097](https://github.com/Agenta-AI/agenta/pull/4347#discussion_r3266169097)
- **File**: `docs/designs/support-fields/proposal.md` "What changes for clients" section, ~L245-L252
- **Fix shipped**: Replaced the "suppressed-failure body is the only breaking change on the wire" paragraph with one that names all three changing response shapes (suppressed failures, intercepted 5xx, intercepted 409) and tells clients to read `x-ag-support-id` / `x-ag-support-ts` headers instead of body fields. Matches the table at L234-L239.
- **Action**: GitHub thread replied to ([discussion_r3266331507](https://github.com/Agenta-AI/agenta/pull/4347#discussion_r3266331507)) and resolved.

### [CLOSED] F-014 — `gap.md` "does NOT solve" stale bullet removed

- **Origin**: PR #4347 sync, 12th Copilot pass
- **PR comment**: [discussion_r3266169147](https://github.com/Agenta-AI/agenta/pull/4347#discussion_r3266169147)
- **File**: `docs/designs/support-fields/gap.md` "What this does NOT solve" section, ~L113-L116
- **Fix shipped**: Deleted the bullet that claimed "this doesn't change the `detail` shape on 5xx errors" — the cleanup *did* land in this PR (intercepted 5xx and 409 `detail` no longer carry `support_id` / `support_ts`; see proposal.md table). The remaining bullets in the section are still accurate.
- **Action**: GitHub thread replied to ([discussion_r3266331729](https://github.com/Agenta-AI/agenta/pull/4347#discussion_r3266331729)) and resolved.

### [CLOSED] F-001 — Production middleware order silently dropped the support headers

- **ID**: F-001
- **Origin**: scan
- **Lens**: verification
- **Severity**: P1 (upgraded from P2 once reproduced)
- **Confidence**: high
- **Status**: fixed
- **Category**: Correctness / Testing
- **Activation Condition**: any suppressed or intercepted failure on a real route where `authentication_middleware`, `analytics_middleware`, or the EE `throttling_middleware` is in the chain (every route in production).
- **Summary**: `SupportHeadersMiddleware` was pure-ASGI (good), but originally registered *outside* `authentication_middleware` and `analytics_middleware` (both `BaseHTTPMiddleware`-style via `app.middleware("http")`). `BaseHTTPMiddleware` runs the downstream app in a child anyio task and decouples `send` via memory streams, so the response is drained back in the outer task. The handler's `support_ctx.set(...)` happens in the child task; the support middleware's `send_with_support` runs in the outer task where `support_ctx` was never mutated. Headers were silently dropped on every real request. Empirically reproduced via a new integration test (`test_support_headers_survive_base_http_middleware`).
- **Evidence**:
  - Pre-fix test failure: `AssertionError: assert 'x-ag-support-id' in Headers({'content-length': '11', 'content-type': 'application/json'})`
  - Starlette `BaseHTTPMiddleware` uses `anyio.create_task_group` + memory streams for `send`, breaking ContextVar back-propagation.
- **Files**:
  - `api/entrypoints/routers.py`
  - `api/oss/tests/pytest/unit/utils/test_exceptions.py`
- **Cause**: ContextVar mutations in a child anyio task do not propagate back to the parent task; the original middleware order placed `SupportHeadersMiddleware` in the parent.
- **Fix Applied**: moved `app.add_middleware(SupportHeadersMiddleware)` to be registered FIRST in [api/entrypoints/routers.py](../../../api/entrypoints/routers.py) (innermost wrapping, beneath all `BaseHTTPMiddleware`s), with an inline comment explaining the constraint. Added `test_support_headers_survive_base_http_middleware` that mirrors production stacking — passes after the fix.
- **Alternatives**: migrate `authentication_middleware` / `analytics_middleware` to pure-ASGI (larger surface, out of scope).

### [CLOSED] F-002 — Schema-level guard on `Support` fields

- **ID**: F-002
- **Origin**: scan
- **Lens**: verification
- **Severity**: P3
- **Confidence**: high
- **Status**: fixed
- **Category**: Testing
- **Summary**: The header middleware reads `support.support_id` / `support.support_ts` behind truthy guards. If `Support` ever renames or drops a field, the middleware silently emits no header. No structural assertion pinned the contract.
- **Evidence**:
  - Field-guarded header emission: [api/oss/src/apis/fastapi/shared/utils.py](../../../api/oss/src/apis/fastapi/shared/utils.py)
  - `Support` definition: [api/oss/src/utils/context.py](../../../api/oss/src/utils/context.py)
- **Files**:
  - `api/oss/tests/pytest/unit/utils/test_exceptions.py`
- **Cause**: optional fields + silent skip + no schema assertion.
- **Fix Applied**: added `test_support_model_has_expected_fields` asserting `set(Support.model_fields) >= {"support_id", "support_ts"}` in [api/oss/tests/pytest/unit/utils/test_exceptions.py](../../../api/oss/tests/pytest/unit/utils/test_exceptions.py).

### [CLOSED] F-003 — Support metadata leaked into intercepted error bodies (409 and 500)

- **ID**: F-003
- **Origin**: scan
- **Lens**: verification
- **Severity**: P2
- **Confidence**: high
- **Status**: fixed
- **Category**: Consistency
- **Summary**: `intercept_exceptions` raised `ConflictException(..., support_id=..., support_ts=...)` and built the 5xx `detail` with `support_id` / `support_ts`. `BaseHTTPException.__init__` folds `**kwargs` into `detail`, so both 409 and 500 bodies carried support fields — inconsistent with the proposal's "headers only" intent.
- **Evidence**:
  - Pre-fix raise sites in `api/oss/src/utils/exceptions.py` (conflict branch + generic-5xx branch)
- **Files**:
  - `api/oss/src/utils/exceptions.py`
  - `docs/designs/support-fields/proposal.md`
  - `api/oss/tests/pytest/unit/utils/test_exceptions.py`
- **Cause**: original design kept body fields for back-compat; user decided headers-only.
- **Fix Applied**:
  - Removed `support_id` / `support_ts` from the `ConflictException(...)` call site.
  - Removed `support_id` / `support_ts` from the generic-5xx `detail` dict; only `message` and `operation_id` remain.
  - Updated `proposal.md` §4 + the "What changes for clients" table to reflect headers-only behavior across 5xx and 409.
  - Rewrote `test_intercept_exceptions_includes_support_metadata` → `test_intercept_exceptions_attaches_support_to_context`, asserting absence of `support_id` / `support_ts` in `detail` and presence on `support_ctx`.

### [CLOSED] F-004 — `tasks.md` checklist + post-merge regen

- **ID**: F-004
- **Origin**: scan
- **Severity**: P3
- **Confidence**: high
- **Status**: wontfix (handled outside this scan)
- **Category**: Process
- **Summary**: `tasks.md` boxes still unchecked; OpenAPI regeneration (task §8, formerly §7 before [[F-008]] renumber) hadn't run, so the Fern-generated client types still list the fields.
- **Resolution**: user is regenerating API docs separately. No action from this scan.

### [CLOSED] F-005 — Proposal overstated the "no more `request:`" claim

- **ID**: F-005
- **Origin**: scan
- **Severity**: P3
- **Confidence**: medium
- **Status**: fixed
- **Category**: Documentation
- **Summary**: `proposal.md` §3 said "the handler no longer needs to take `request: Request` for support headers to work." True for `suppress_exceptions`, false for `intercept_exceptions` (which still pops `request` from kwargs for log enrichment).
- **Files**:
  - `docs/designs/support-fields/proposal.md`
- **Fix Applied**: tightened the "Key differences vs. today" bullets in `proposal.md` §3 to scope the claim to `suppress_exceptions` and explicitly note that `intercept_exceptions` retains the `kwargs.pop("request", None)` block for logging only.

### [CLOSED] F-006 — `x-ag-support-*` headers were not CORS-exposed

- **ID**: F-006
- **Origin**: scan
- **Severity**: P3
- **Confidence**: high
- **Status**: fixed
- **Category**: Compatibility
- **Activation Condition**: any cross-origin browser client (web app at `localhost:3000`, `agenta.ai`, Vercel preview, etc.) attempting `response.headers.get("x-ag-support-id")` after a fetch hits `suppress_exceptions`.
- **Summary**: `CORSMiddleware` had no `expose_headers`. Per CORS spec, browser JS can only read response headers listed in `Access-Control-Expose-Headers` (custom `x-ag-*` headers are not in the safelist). Headers were emitted on the wire but invisible to web clients.
- **Files**:
  - `api/entrypoints/routers.py`
- **Fix Applied**: added `expose_headers=["x-ag-support-id", "x-ag-support-ts"]` to `CORSMiddleware` in [api/entrypoints/routers.py](../../../api/entrypoints/routers.py).

### [CLOSED] F-007 — `tasks.md` §3 still said "leave detail unchanged for back-compat"

- **ID**: F-007
- **Origin**: sync
- **Lens**: validation
- **Severity**: P3
- **Confidence**: high
- **Status**: fixed
- **Category**: Documentation
- **Summary**: `tasks.md` task §3 instructed: "call `attach_support(support)` for the side-effect, leave the `detail` payload unchanged for back-compat." The shipped implementation ([[F-003]]) had already removed `support_id` / `support_ts` from both the conflict and generic-5xx `detail` — headers-only. The stale checklist could have misled future contributors into reintroducing the body fields.
- **Evidence**:
  - PR thread [#discussion_r3264315906](https://github.com/Agenta-AI/agenta/pull/4325#discussion_r3264315906) (Copilot, 2026-05-19)
- **Files**:
  - `docs/designs/support-fields/tasks.md`
- **Cause**: doc authored before the headers-only decision, not updated when [[F-003]] landed.
- **Fix Applied**: rewrote task §3's `intercept_exceptions` bullet to describe headers-only behavior: strip `support_id` / `support_ts` from `detail` in both the `EntityCreationConflict` and generic-exception branches (drop the `support_id=` / `support_ts=` kwargs from the `ConflictException` call site since `BaseHTTPException.__init__` folds `**kwargs` into `detail`). Kept the unrelated `kwargs.pop("request", None)` logging block. See [tasks.md](./tasks.md).
- **Sources**: PR #4325 review `4316541442`.

### [CLOSED] F-008 — `tasks.md` had duplicate `## 4` section numbering

- **ID**: F-008
- **Origin**: sync
- **Lens**: validation
- **Severity**: P3
- **Confidence**: high
- **Status**: fixed
- **Category**: Documentation
- **Summary**: `tasks.md` declared two `## 4` headings — "Middleware" and "Strip `Support` inheritance from response models". Section references were ambiguous.
- **Evidence**:
  - PR thread [#discussion_r3264315970](https://github.com/Agenta-AI/agenta/pull/4325#discussion_r3264315970) (Copilot, 2026-05-19)
- **Files**:
  - `docs/designs/support-fields/tasks.md`
  - `docs/designs/support-fields/findings.md` (updated `[[F-004]]` cross-reference from "task §7" to "task §8")
- **Cause**: numbering not renumbered when "Strip inheritance" was added/split.
- **Fix Applied**: renumbered "Strip `Support` inheritance from response models" to `## 5`, cascading `## 5 → ## 6` (Tests), `## 6 → ## 7` (Smoke test), `## 7 → ## 8` (Regenerate API docs), `## 8 → ## 9` (PR). Updated the one cross-reference in [[F-004]] that named the old "task §7" to read "task §8".
- **Sources**: PR #4325 review `4316541442`.

### [CLOSED] F-009 — `gap.md` "Files to change" row still said "Keep detail payload for back-compat"

- **ID**: F-009
- **Origin**: sync
- **Lens**: validation
- **Severity**: P3
- **Confidence**: high
- **Status**: fixed
- **Category**: Documentation
- **Summary**: Two stale claims in `gap.md` contradicted the headers-only behavior shipped in [[F-003]]:
  1. The `api/oss/src/utils/exceptions.py` row in the target-state "Files to change" table said "Keep `detail` payload in `intercept_exceptions` for back-compat."
  2. The "Files that do not change" bullet listed `intercept_exceptions`'s `detail` body shape as unchanged.
- **Evidence**:
  - PR thread [#discussion_r3264315985](https://github.com/Agenta-AI/agenta/pull/4325#discussion_r3264315985) (Copilot, 2026-05-19)
- **Files**:
  - `docs/designs/support-fields/gap.md`
- **Cause**: doc not updated when [[F-003]] landed.
- **Fix Applied**: rewrote the exceptions.py row to: "Strip `support_id` / `support_ts` from `intercept_exceptions` `detail` (headers-only); both decorators rely on `support_ctx` + `SupportHeadersMiddleware` for client visibility." Also softened the "Files that do not change" bullet to clarify that `message` and `operation_id` remain in the body but support fields move to headers. Closely related to [[F-007]] — fixed in the same pass.
- **Sources**: PR #4325 review `4316541442`.

### [CLOSED] F-010 — Unit test mirrored `SupportHeadersMiddleware` with a stale docstring

- **ID**: F-010
- **Origin**: sync
- **Lens**: validation
- **Severity**: P3
- **Confidence**: high
- **Status**: fixed
- **Category**: Testing
- **Summary**: `test_exceptions.py` defined a local `_SupportHeadersMiddleware` class that mirrored production behavior, with a docstring claiming it had to be a local mirror because importing the real one would pull the full app composition root. Two problems:
  1. The production class actually lives in [api/oss/src/apis/fastapi/shared/utils.py](../../../api/oss/src/apis/fastapi/shared/utils.py), not `entrypoints.routers` (the entrypoint just registers it). The docstring's import-path rationale was stale.
  2. `SupportHeadersMiddleware` is lightweight (pure-ASGI; transitively pulls only `oss.src.core.shared.dtos` and `oss.src.utils.context`, no DAOs or services), so the "too heavy for a unit test" claim was false. The local mirror could drift from production silently.
- **Evidence**:
  - PR thread [#discussion_r3264316015](https://github.com/Agenta-AI/agenta/pull/4325#discussion_r3264316015) (Copilot, 2026-05-19)
- **Files**:
  - `api/oss/tests/pytest/unit/utils/test_exceptions.py`
- **Cause**: original test written before middleware was extracted into `shared/utils.py`; not refactored when the extraction happened.
- **Fix Applied**: deleted the local `_SupportHeadersMiddleware` class (and its stale docstring), imported `SupportHeadersMiddleware` from `oss.src.apis.fastapi.shared.utils`, and replaced both `app.add_middleware(_SupportHeadersMiddleware)` call sites (in `_build_test_app` and `_build_test_app_with_base_http_middleware`) with the real class. Verified all 7 tests in the file pass against the real middleware via `python run-tests.py --env-file ../hosting/docker-compose/ee/.env.ee.dev -- oss/tests/pytest/unit/utils/test_exceptions.py`. `ruff format` + `ruff check` clean.
