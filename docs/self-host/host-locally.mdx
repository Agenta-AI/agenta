## Prerequisites

You'll need Docker installed on your machine. If you don't have it yet, download and install it from [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

<Warning> Before you start, make sure that the port 80 is not being used by other applications. To free up resources, you can run docker system prune. </Warning>

## Starting Agenta in Production Mode 

```bash
mkdir agenta && cd agenta
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Agenta-AI/agenta/main/docker-compose.gh.yml -o docker-compose.yml && docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
````


## Starting agenta in Development Mode

### 1. Clone the Repository and Navigate to the Folder

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Agenta-AI/agenta.git
cd agenta
```

### 2. Launch the Agenta Server

```bash
docker compose -f "docker-compose.yml" up -d --build
```


## Verify the Installation

Open your browser and go to [http://localhost](http://localhost). If you see the Agenta web interface, you're good to go.

## What's next?
You're all set to start using Agenta!
