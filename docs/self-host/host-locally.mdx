## Prerequisites

You'll need Docker installed on your machine. If you don't have it yet, download and install it from [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

<Warning> Before you start, make sure that the port 80 is not being used by other applications. To free up resources, you can run docker system prune. </Warning>

## Starting agenta in Production Mode 

```bash
mkdir agenta && cd agenta
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/agenta-ai/agenta/main/docker-compose.gh.yml -o docker-compose.gh.yml
docker compose -f docker-compose.gh.yml up -d
```

<Warning>**To update to the last version of agenta**. Please run  `docker compose -f docker-compose.gh.yml up -d --pull always` Which forces docker to pull the last version of the image</Warning>


## Starting agenta in Development Mode

### 1. Clone the Repository and Navigate to the Folder

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Agenta-AI/agenta.git
cd agenta
```

### 2. Launch the Agenta Server

```bash
docker compose -f "docker-compose.yml" up -d --build
```


## Verify the Installation

Open your browser and go to [http://localhost](http://localhost). If you see the Agenta web interface, you're good to go.

<Accordion title="Troubleshooting.">
  The most likely reason for failure is a port conflict. To check whether this is the case please check whether the containers for agenta are all running (agenta-web, agenta-backend, mongodb and redis) and check the logs for the containers agenta-web and agenta-backend.

  If that is not the problem, please [file an issue in github](https://github.com/Agenta-AI/agenta/issues/new/choose) or reach out on [#support on Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/agenta-hq/shared_invite/zt-1zsafop5i-Y7~ZySbhRZvKVPV5DO_7IA). We are very active there and **should answer within minutes** (European time).

  You can also check the most common problems in the [troubleshooting section](/howto/how-to-debug) of the documentation.

## What's next?
You're all set to start using Agenta!
