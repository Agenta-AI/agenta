## Upgrading to the Latest Version

To upgrade to the latest version of Agenta, execute the following command:

```
docker compose -f docker-compose.gh.yml up -d --pull always

```

This command instructs Docker to fetch and use the latest version of the Agenta image.

## Database Migration with Beanie

This guide offers detailed steps for performing database migrations in the Agenta backend system, using Beanie, a MongoDB ODM (Object Document Mapper) for Python. You can learn more about Beanie [here](https://github.com/roman-right/beanie).

### Setting Up Beanie

To install a custom version of Beanie:

```
git clone <https://github.com/mmabrouk/beanie>
cd beanie
pip install .

```
