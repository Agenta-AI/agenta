## v0.13.1-5 - Evaluation Speed Increase and Numerous Quality of Life Improvements
*23rd April 2024*

- We've improved the speed of evaluations by 3x through the use of asynchronous batching of calls.
- We've added Groq as a new provider along with Llama3 to our playground.

**Bug Fixes**

- Resolved a rendering UI bug in Testset view.
- Fixed incorrect URLs displayed when running the 'agenta variant serve' command.
- Corrected timestamps in the configuration.
- Resolved errors when using the chat template with empty input.
- Fixed latency format in evaluation view.
- Added a spinner to the Human Evaluation results table.
- Resolved an issue where the gitignore was being overwritten when running 'agenta init'.


## v0.13.0 - Observability (beta)
*14th April 2024*

You can now monitor your application usage in production. We've added a new observability feature (currently in beta), which allows you to:

- Monitor cost, latency, and the number of calls to your applications in real-time.
- View the logs of your LLM calls, including inputs, outputs, and used configurations. You can also add any interesting logs to your test set.
- Trace your more complex LLM applications to understand the logic within and debug it.

As of now, all new applications created will include observability by default. We are working towards a GA version in the next weeks, which will be scalable and better integrated with your applications. We will also be adding tutorials and documentation about it.

<img height="600" src="/images/changelog/eval_1.png" />

2. Rate Limit Parameters: Specify these during evaluations and reattempts to ensure reliable results without exceeding open AI rate limits.

<img height="600" src="/images/changelog/eval_2.png" />

3. Reusable Evaluators: Configure evaluators such as similarity match, regex match, or AI critique and use them across multiple evaluations.

<img height="600" src="/images/changelog/eval_3.png" />

**Evaluation Reports**

1. Dashboard Improvements: We've upgraded our dashboard interface to better display evaluation results. You can now filter and sort results by evaluator, test set, and outcomes.

<img height="600" src="/images/changelog/eval_4.png" />

2. Comparative Analysis: Select multiple evaluation runs and view the results of various LLM applications side-by-side.

## v0.7.1 - Adding Cost and Token Usage to the Playground

*12th January 2024*
<Warning> This change requires you to pull the latest version of the agenta platform if you're using the self-serve version.</Warning>

<img height="600" src="/images/changelog/screenshot_cost_and_token_usage.png" />

We've added a feature that allows you to compare the time taken by an LLM app, its cost, and track token usage, all in one place.

### Changes to the SDK

This necessitated modifications to the SDK. Now, the LLM application API returns a JSON instead of a string. The JSON includes the output message, usage details, and cost:

```
{
 "message": string,
 "usage": {
  "prompt_tokens": int,
  "completion_tokens": int,
  "total_tokens": int
 },
 "cost": float
}
```
