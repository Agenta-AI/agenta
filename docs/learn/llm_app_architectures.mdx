There are multitude of architectures or pipelines for LLM applications. We discuss here the main ones. 

## The Single Prompt Architecture

This architecture is the simplest. The LLM application is a simple wrapper around one prompt / LLM call. 

In agenta you can [create such LLM apps from the UI](/quickstart/getting-started-ui). Or you can [use your own code](quickstart/getting-started-code) in case that your [model is not supported](tutorials/deploy-mistral-model) (or you would like to add some custom logic for pre-processing or post-processing the inputs).

## The Chain-of-prompt Architecture

The chain of prompt architecture as its name suggest is based on calling an LLM and then injecting the output into a second call as shown in the figure.
