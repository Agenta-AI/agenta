## Introduction

This guide outlines building a basic LLM app with **langchain** and **agenta**. By the end, you'll have a functional LLM app and knowledge of how to use the agenta CLI.

To learn more about creating an LLM app from scratch, please visit our [advanced tutorial](/tutorials/your-first-llm-app).

## Prerequisites

Before beginning, install the Agenta CLI and SDK, and set up the web platform using docker-compose. Follow our [installation guide](/installation) if needed.

## Step 1: Initialize a New Project

Create a new folder and initialize it with the following commands:

```bash
mkdir example_app; cd example_app
agenta init
```

Start a new project using the simple_prompt template:

````
? Please enter the app name company_name_generator
? Are you running agenta locally? Yes
? How do you want to initialize your app? Start from template
? Which template do you want to use? simple_prompt - Simple app that uses one prompt using langchain
App initialized successfully
Please check the README.md for further instructions to setup the template.
````

The initialization creates several files, including app.py. For a detailed explanation, proceed to the next step or continue with the tutorial.

<Accordion title="Understand the Generated Code">

The files generated include:

```bash
.
├── README.md
├── app.py
├── config.toml
└── requirements.txt
```

Let's take a closer look at the code in app.py:

### README.md
An overview of your application.

### requirements.txt
A list of the required dependencies.

### config.toml
Configuration details, currently only the app name.

### app.py
The main application file, containing code to set up a simple LLM-application using OpenAI's Python library.
</Accordion>

## Step 2: Set up the OpenAI API Key

You'll need to configure the OpenAI API key. Here's how:

1. Visit the [OpenAI API keys page](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys), and create a new key. 

2. Create a file `.env` in your project folder and add the line:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxx
```

<Accordion title="(Optional Step) Run the application from the CLI">

To test your application via the command line, optionally create a virtual environment, install dependencies, and run the application:

```bash
python -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py "LLMOps developer platform"

    CypressOps Platform.
```

</Accordion>

## Step 3: Run the Application in the Playground

To run your app in the playground, serve it locally using `agenta variant serve`. This command:

1. Creates a Docker image and starts a container.
2. Starts a server exposing the endpoint /generate at `localhost/{app_name}/{variant_name}/openapi.json`.
3. Adds the application to the Agenta's web UI.

```bash
agenta variant serve --file_name app.py
```

This will do two things:
1. It will create a docker image of the application, and start a container based on this image.
2. The container will start a server exposing an endpoint /generate with the same parameters we specified in the application at `localhost/{app_name}/{variant_name}/openapi.json`.
3. It will add the application to the web ui Agenta

## Step 4: Start Experimenting

Visit `localhost:3000`, select your app, and experiment with different parameters in the playground.

The playground lets you create new app variants and tweak application parameters.

We hope you find this guide helpful. Happy coding!
