Agenta is an open-source end-to-end platform that helps **developers** and **product teams** build and maintain robust AI applications powered with Large Language Models (LLMs). . 

With agenta, you can:

1. Quickly **experiment** and **compare** prompts, configurations and complex pipelines (chains, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), agents...) 
2. Quickly **create test sets** and **golden datasets** for evaluation
3. **Evaluate** your applications with pre-existing or **custom Evaluators**
4. **Annotate** and **A/B test** your applications with human feedback 
5. **Collaborate with product teams** for prompt engineering and evaluation
6. **Deploy** your application in one-click in the UI,  through CLI, or through github workflows. 

Agenta focuses on increasing the speed of the development cycle of LLM applications by increasing the speed of iteration.

Agenta integrates with all frameworks and model providers in the ecosystem, such as [Langchain](https://langchain.com), [LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/), [OpenAI](https://openai.com), [Cohere](https://cohere.ai), [Mistral](https://mistral.ai/), [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/), and self-hosted open source LLMs such as the one served using [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm)
