## Folders for Prompt Organization

### LinkedIn

Folders are live in Agenta.

Prompts pile up when you're building agents. We added folders so you can organize them. Create folders, drag prompts into them, nest subfolders. Works like a file system.

Folder URLs persist, so you can link teammates to the right place.
