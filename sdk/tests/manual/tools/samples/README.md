# Sample Files

This directory contains sample files for testing various LLM capabilities:

## Files

- **file.txt** - Plain text document for file search and RAG testing
- **code.py** - Python code for code execution and analysis
- **data.csv** - CSV data for data analysis testing

## Usage

These files are used by the test script to validate:
- File upload capabilities
- Document analysis
- Code execution with file inputs
- Data processing

## Note

### Documentation Files

The test suite includes comprehensive documentation:

- **tools.specs.json**: Tool format specifications for each provider
  - Shows the exact structure required for each tool type
  - Covers all providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google)
  - Includes special configurations (headers, parameters, etc.)

- **tools.examples.json**: Usage examples in JSON format
  - Contains message bodies ready to use with litellm.completion()
  - Structured as JSON objects (not stringified code)
  - Shows real-world use cases for each tool

These files are auto-generated by `tools.docs.py` and contain information for ALL providers/tools regardless of test filters.

These are minimal test files. For production testing, consider using:
- Larger documents
- More complex code examples
- Real-world datasets
